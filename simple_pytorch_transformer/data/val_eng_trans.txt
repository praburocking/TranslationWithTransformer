Hey, how's it going down there?
Let her sleep.
I won't let you go there.
They're about to leave.
Hold the elevator, Tom.
She is a good dancer.
Show me how to do this.
Why wasn't I informed earlier?
Poverty is the root of all evil.
He sent a letter addressed to his uncle.
I don't need your charity.
They cheat.
A rainbow is a natural phenomenon.
The dog was frozen to death.
Let's get out while we can.
I often hear her play the piano.
Please tell me you're joking.
Where is he standing?
Stop trying.
Tom has lots of money.
My hands and legs are swollen.
That seems unlikely.
I started studying French when I was thirteen.
I am tired.
Tom's scared.
I think everyone looks back on their childhood with some regret.
You are my daughter.
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.
I've never worn a tuxedo.
I wake up at half past six in the morning.
I know Tom is tough.
Do you have an English dictionary?
Tom is taking care of the kids.
I may have something for you.
Can I have a word with you alone?
Make yourself at home.
His joke was great.
She arrived late as usual.
Just a minute.
I missed the train. I should have come earlier.
My uncle gave his car to me.
Are you going to attend the meeting?
Tom wanted Mary to cooperate.
All you have to do is study harder.
This is Tom's car.
I intended to have been a teacher.
Could you give me a discount?
What's life like where you live?
He came to my rescue.
Chess and checkers are favorites with them.
He managed to pass the examination.
You're all right.
I also went there.
You're opportunistic.
He's writing a long letter.
Don't worry about it!
I have other plans for you.
There was only one case of chicken pox at the school.
Her socks are gray.
I'm glad I did it.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
You have only to ask for his help.
Tom asked how much the ticket cost.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
They're still together.
I wonder if I can do that.
It's rather cold for April.
You ought to ask for your teacher's permission.
How much is it in dollars?
There's a pyramid in Mexico bigger than any of those in Egypt.
These problems will be solved in the near future.
You can't see Tom anymore.
Tell me what I did wrong.
I have to say I envy you.
We're not home.
Did the police arrest Tom?
Be more careful from now on.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
I didn't do well on the test so my parents chewed me out.
Were you fat when you were in high school?
I felt naked.
That amplifier doesn't work.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
Hand me the wrench.
Do you mind if I sleep here?
What you're doing makes me nervous.
You should stay away from Tom.
Follow your desire.
When was this church built?
Tom lost hope.
I would also like to rent a car.
The measurements need to be precise.
It was an impulse buy.
He always plays well.
For further information, see page 16.
I met the president himself.
That's probably just a coincidence.
I'm much younger than you.
Please loan me your dictionary.
She can't ride a bicycle.
Turn off the lights.
I heard everything.
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be a race car driver.
I'm powerless.
Do you still have feelings for her?
Shake hands with him.
I can't control what happens.
You need a joystick.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
I never claimed that I could speak French.
What are your plans for tonight?
My belief is that he will succeed.
You should stay at home today.
The price of meat dropped.
I have an appointment at 2:30.
There are a lot of beautiful songs on these records.
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
They fear that he may be dead.
Can you tell me what this word means?
I don't know what else we should do.
He didn't want to do it.
He lives far away from his hometown.
I know Tom isn't guilty.
Would you elaborate?
The hikers were all but frozen when they were found.
He seems to be asleep.
Right now I can't think of anything else.
I don't like your going out alone.
Do you still want to go to the lighthouse?
She advised him to be more careful.
Do you have health insurance?
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
Tom greeted me politely.
She divided the cake into five pieces.
We are playing tennis this weekend.
I advised him not to drive.
Does anyone in your office speak French?
I've done everything.
Don't blame the guide.
Tom is smashed.
Not a sound was to be heard in the concert hall.
The house was in flames.
Is there anyone else who wants to eat?
He was humiliated by her.
Would you like to be famous?
I should've worn a coat.
I'm just kidding.
I have to change clothes.
We could meet downtown. Would that be convenient for you?
I go shopping every other day.
Where did you hide it?
What are you supposed to do?
We discussed what to do.
When are you going to get married?
Tom has never been to a circus.
There's a large risk involved.
We all lie.
All of us want to live as long as possible.
My wife has faults. None the less, I love her.
Tom seemed disappointed.
Where do you go on Monday evenings?
I can't help laughing at him.
They never did an autopsy.
Does she come from the agency that sent the last temporary I had?
If you do not have this book, you can buy it.
Don't forget to include me in the count.
She doesn't need to work.
The arrow glanced off the tree.
You weren't even there.
It's against the rules.
We can't just ignore this problem.
He will be here all evening.
You're the teacher.
Try to stop me.
His wife is one of my friends.
I didn't get the job.
I have an audition today.
I'm free.
I really don't want to play.
She got married at seventeen.
You can't attend? Why not?
You could go back to Boston if you wanted to.
I got my leg hurt in the accident.
I'd like to be friends.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
I just want to hang out with you.
I always watch the weather report before going out in the morning.
Do you mind if I go?
I might stay.
It's none of your business.
Why don't you just study a little harder?
This is ours.
How long does it take from here to the station?
I have to check and see what the contract says.
My friend said he had bought a new watch.
There are many abandoned cats in the world.
She doesn't know how to drive a car.
Leaving something unfinished is the worst thing you can do.
Tom doesn't go out with Mary anymore.
I'm tired of being treated like a kid.
Just think about how you'd feel in a similar situation.
I took an arrow in the knee.
How many books have you read?
I do not like science.
He seems to know us.
That doesn't really make any sense.
He canceled the appointment at the last moment.
Do you know why he wasn't at school?
I was sitting behind Tom.
I've always thought you knew how to swim.
He let us go.
He bought the land for the purpose of building a house on it.
You must do exactly as I tell you.
Do you like sports?
I needed to meet you.
The horse chafed at the bit put in its mouth.
You've got to go even if you don't want to.
I have no one to leave my money to.
Tom knows a lot of people.
Could we make this a priority?
Tom was afraid that they'd lock him up and throw away the key.
It's not safe to swim in that river.
I'll keep it in mind.
You're not thinking clearly.
None of these are mine.
He lost his job.
He is my friend.
This book is about stars.
Frankly speaking, it's difficult to understand why you want to go.
Stop right there, please.
Please leave this room.
I thought Tom was unemployed.
I have no time.
I would like to thank you for your collaboration.
You should take care of yourself.
It was all for nothing.
She is a very poor driver.
Where do you want to eat?
Tom forgot to salute.
She spoke to him about the matter.
The government collapsed after a vote in parliament.
I was afraid I'd never see you again.
I've heard of you.
I'm faithful.
She's putting the children to bed.
I am glad to help you.
I have no wish to see the man again.
Don't believe everything you hear.
My sister is pretty.
I lit the match.
The school was established in 1650.
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
Tom said he was looking for a place to eat.
We shared ideas.
Do you have a menu in English?
Choose your next words carefully.
You look very tired.
Well begun is half done.
He seemed to be ill.
My apartment is near here.
They ate and drank wine.
Am I not right?
The pharmacy isn't far from the hospital.
Do you remember?
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
He sent the letter back unopened.
There used to be some big trees around the pond.
Tom almost caught Mary.
I regarded the man as an enemy.
The police covered the body with a sheet.
I forgot to tell you who would meet you at the station.
He spoke for ten minutes without a pause.
You should go home now.
It snowed.
Children often hate spinach.
I want to see you in your office in half an hour.
I know what it feels like.
Would you like to have lunch together?
What does he say?
My idea is quite different from yours.
You're fair.
He lives next door to us.
You're a wonderful friend.
I passed the test with flying colors.
I thought you were asleep.
Since he was tired, he was sitting on the sofa with his eyes closed.
I know you've got more important things to do.
Sit here.
Why are you selling this furniture?
Tom speaks French better than you do.
I can't do what I'm being paid to do.
Hokkaido is to the north of Honshu.
A gentleman is always kind to others.
What a big truck!
Choose your next words carefully.
She talked to the chairman.
I come here as often as I can.
We're very busy.
My mother made a sweater for me.
That's not such a bad idea.
You probably eat genetically modified fruits and vegetables all the time without knowing it.
Let me introduce you to a new way of doing that.
The more you study, the more you discover your ignorance.
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
It was kind of weird.
You may not agree with him, but at least he stands up for what he believes in.
I wish that Tom was here to help us.
What kind of training have you had?
Tell Tom that I'm angry.
Tom adopted Mary's three children.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I recommend you to go by train.
What did you think I was going to suggest?
You have been warned.
It was lucky for you that you found it.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
I went home.
They're awake.
The boy caught the cat by the tail.
Don't point your gun at me.
I doubt it.
It's a good way to make friends.
I think Tom can help.
I know this isn't hard.
I cannot praise her enough.
I won't be quiet.
He has no children.
Is that what you were talking about last night?
I thought this was mine.
I'd be delighted if you could join us for dinner.
Tom is my new best friend.
The answers are both incorrect.
Get out of my way.
Don't be fresh to me.
Who is your favorite actor?
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
How did you accomplish this?
Can you make yourself understood in Japanese?
I want to write this down.
Tom is writing a book.
Did you vote?
The day is almost over.
Tom watches TV all the time.
How did they find out?
Quit acting like a child.
There's a way to do it.
Could you tell me where I can get a train?
Can you teach me how to do that?
You look so beautiful.
He only thinks about himself.
We need your assistance.
I can't swim at all.
The crew is busy preparing for the voyage into outer space.
That was a shock.
I understand you.
It's really hot there.
He is not what he used to be.
Tom should've won the race.
Scientists are slowly piecing together the mechanism of aging.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
Place it wherever you like.

Tell them who you are.
Trust me on this.

Tom knows it's useless.
I want you to promise me something.
He said good night to his parents.
I have been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
He ripped up all her letters and photos.
He was too short to get at the grapes.
Can you help me wash these dishes?
She was tired. However, she tried to finish the work.
I'm not paranoid.
Please see to it that the dog doesn't go out.
When was the last time you slept more than ten hours?
If you eat three square meals a day, your body will have the energy it needs.
Let's go do what we have to do.
You make me laugh a lot.
Who can tell what will happen in the future?
Everybody seems to be having a good time.
They can't be ignored.
Air is a mixture of gases.
These are our kids.
I can't find Tom.
Tom is deranged.
Don't you know his name?

It's no use arguing with him.
I feel giddy.
It was a stroke of genius.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?

That boy denies stealing the bicycle.
I bought this book at Kakuzen's.
I'm not done with you.
Will I be able to find it?
You don't want to know.
What's your phone number?
Why all the drama?
I'm very pleased with your work.
I'm not sure that that's a good thing.
My brother is healthy.
Tom did twenty pushups.
Do you spend much time writing email?
Do you know where my watch is?
Do you know where she is?
Tom is a lazy person.
At the end of the speech she repeated the word.
You can't leave.
I'm not going to help you.
I will go on foot.
I am in a spot.
By the way, what's your address?
I think you're bleeding.
We finally did it.

I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
You really annoy me.
I think we can trust Tom.

Some of my friends can speak English well.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
I can't imagine what you're going through.

I don't want to tell him.
The whole world hungers for peace.
He bent over backward to please his wife.
Let's take the 4:10 train.

It's been snowing all night.
Tom began to search the house.
Do you remember what you were watching?
We're happy with our car.
Bring a camera.
I can't believe that you enjoyed that movie.
The rule holds good in this case.
It is true in a sense.
He took off his hat.
The Japanese economy grew by 4% last year.
He abandoned his family.
Who knows what's going to happen?
Let someone else handle it.
One student was arrested.
They were perfect.
Where's the bag?
That's not wrong.
It's time to go.
They're enjoying themselves.
I appreciate all you did.
I love you more than ever.
I don't know if I can handle this alone.
I called your office today, but you weren't in.
I'm glad you got home safely.
He ruined my life.
The air we breathe consists of oxygen and nitrogen.

Are you envious?
The experiment was successful.
Let's get out of this place.
I like their pictures.
My father made me a nice lunch.
You're fun.
Do you still love him?
Going back to South Africa had stirred up some painful memories for him.
That's real nice of you.
I thought I'd try eating Mexican food today.
Eat more vegetables.

She looks like a teacher.
Take as many cookies as you want.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
Just throw your bicycle in the back of the truck and I'll drive you home.
Tom works there.
Frankly, I don't care.
I get asked that question a lot.
Her mother is a wonderful pianist.
I went to see the movies yesterday.
"May I use your telephone?" "By all means."
That isn't big enough.
How come I've never seen you here before?
He told me that his father was dead.
We have no other choice.
She is in a bad mood.
Is it that hard?
Nobody can replace Tom.
Don't try to make me angry.
We need to remember to mail this letter tomorrow.
We're powerless.
He pinched me!
Everyone knew what went wrong.
I have hardly any English books.
She's hot.
I didn't know that at the time.
I've forgotten your address.
I'm prepared.
Remain seated, please.
What games do you have on your phone?
He does not like being punished.
Do you drink beer?
I knew something wasn't right about that guy.
He was so drunk that his explanation did not make sense.
Tom will eventually give in, I think.
I'd like to sing you a song.
I saw the person I expected standing there.
School is boring.
I know I shouldn't have done that.
This is her house.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
You're callous.
He feels hurt.
She will surely be enjoying a hot bath at this hour.
Don't touch the flowers.
Come if you can.
I'm coming to help you.
We're contented.
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
Do you know my name?
It is terrible weather today.
They'll be fine.
You should've told me this before.
Don't try to make me angry.
I can hear you loud and clear.
Grammar is very complicated.
I was ready today.
I had a horrible dream last night.
The students all laughed.
Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand.
Don't think about it.
Tom went home at 6:30.
Come to lunch with us.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
She isn't adequate to the task.
It's a misunderstanding.
I hit the jackpot.
Hurry up.
She had a narrow escape.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
My mom is overprotective.
Do you want me to spy on Tom for you?
I used to swim every day when I was a child.
That joke isn't funny.
He's a slob.
I'm humming.
At last, we got the information.
What's Tom's address?
Stop right there, please.
You're cuter than Mary.
He wasn't able to reach his goal.
How old was she when she got married?
I vowed that I would never speak to her again.
Don't exceed the speed limit.
Just keep moving.
Get in the van.
I do not need money now.
See you tomorrow in the library.
You couldn't possibly understand.
I'd recommend taking a break.
I'll never forget your kindness.
You're winning, aren't you?
The old man narrowly escaped being run over by a car.
Do you believe in guardian angels?
I can't do what Tom does.
I know none of the three men.
Tom ignored our advice.
I think I'd like to be your friend.
I never told you to quit.
Do you have to go now?
He was alone in the room.
Is this your wallet?
I'm planning to move to Boston.
How many bags did you have?
I can do it in a week.
Did I give you enough time?
It isn't too late for you.
She looked him right in the eye.
I found a nice tie for Tom.
He acted the part of King Lear.
I'm a little curious.
Tom doesn't even know I exist.
There's no other choice.
Tom is dying.
That might take too long.
I know you're hiding something.
Tom can't be older than Mary.
They tried to discourage him from going.
I would be more careful if I were you.
Can you spin a basketball on your fingertip?
It's the same every year.
The plan calls for a lot of money.
She looked him right in the eyes.
Did you like it?
I read it in a magazine.
I'm not going to do anything you don't want me to.
Your father seems very nice.
Drop your weapons!
I'll pay you back the money I owe you next week.
Have you ever heard someone speaking in French?
That isn't exactly what I said.
Do you want some cherry pie?
Can you show me around?
This isn't so difficult.
I regret that I lied.
It's not stupid.
About how many books do you have?
I haven't decided what to do yet.
You're biased.
That's good for a first try.
Let's let the workers go home early today.
Nobody appreciates me.
Bacteria are invisible to the naked eye.
Most public places are simply not geared to people with disabilities.
Close the door, please.
Tom claims that he has never killed anyone.
I was wondering when you were going to tell me that.
They used truth serum.
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
The meeting was just about over.
Tom undressed and got in the bathtub.
Tom fell asleep and missed the end of the movie.
We were all so busy then.
You're very funny.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
Is Tom one of your friends?
There must be another way.
I want these.
You may use my car.
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
Go straight on down this street.
He opened his mouth wide.
Behave yourself during my absence.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Did you recognize your old classmate?
I have no idea what this means.
After asking for my key at the front desk, I took the elevator to my floor.
Can you write Braille?
Who else is with you?
It is very short.
He joined the English club.
We don't lock our doors.
I still make a lot of mistakes.
I followed you.
I'll make you happy.
I can now die a happy man.
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for October 20th.
Let's leave the matter as it is for the present.
I'd like to talk with you about your grades.
I like the original better than the remix.
Shut the door, please.
He got a prize for winning the competition.
I was just going to say that.
You may sit down on the chair.
I didn't want to speak French.
We're so glad to have you here.
I go to bed after I study.
He pressed the button and waited.
He seems to have no sense of humor.
I can read.
Tom was great tonight.
What are you guys drinking?
He likes my jokes.
Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
He did a real snow job on my daughter.
She is a wonderful wife.
I'm sure Tom is going to be hungry when he gets home.
Take all the time you need.
I'm surprised to see you.
Have you got something for me?
It was nice of you to show up.
I don't believe in magic.
I want my life back.
You were hoping to win, weren't you?
Tom came.
We're among friends.
You don't have to explain.
They had a heated argument.
You're the one who trained me.
There is little hope that they are alive.
If the sun were to rise in the west, I wouldn't change my mind.
I can't stand kids.
The music stopped.
Give the devil his due.
I'll do that tomorrow if possible.
From my point of view, Australia is one of the best countries in the world.
She accompanied him on the piano.
Everybody knows that Tom likes Mary.
You should not wear a fur coat.
Come on.
He's working on it.
I had a hard time leaving.
I'm not apologizing.
I didn't have much time so I just skimmed through the article.
My parents sent me to fat camp when I was thirteen.
This is typical.
I've got a bad case of jet lag.
I get the picture now.
I felt relieved when my plane landed safely.
His son-in-law completely recovered from his illness.
How are you?
She told me that she had bigger fish to fry.
I want to be an actor.
I remember the first time we met.
How do you do it?
Where did you learn to make pizza?
Stop pretending that everything's okay. It's not.
I lost that argument.
I'm very proud of my father.
I remember seeing this before.
He drives me crazy.
I want you to come back.
Tom isn't concerned about that.
Be friendly.
Tom will be arriving any moment.
There is a big hole in your stocking.
I waited for Tom outside.
I have two cats.
That joke he told really cracked me up!
I have an early memory of my grandmother darning socks.
Tom told Mary he was busy.
Please say hello to him for me.
The doctor took my pulse.
The thieves divvied up the proceeds from their heist.
She smiled.
Perfect!
The house seemed empty.
You're disturbing the whole neighborhood.
Tom will be delighted to see you.
Don't you tell me to relax.
As the date of the wedding approached, Tom started having second-thoughts.
He's very open.
Tom is kind of creepy.
I visited Boston last month.
Thanks a million.
Everybody's tired.
The weather is cold all year here.
He tied the dog to a tree.
What's your favorite number?
According to a recent study, the average life span of the Japanese is still increasing.
I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you.
I don't believe we've been formally introduced.
How was the reunion?
What an irritating person!
Tom knows everybody.
That's the only reason I'm here.
I don't have as much money as you think.
It's against my principles.
I can't get my money out of the bank today.
Help us, please.
She looks happiest when she is with him.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
I have a Japanese car.
Tom didn't know Mary.
You're not supposed to be in here.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
My mother happened to be there when the fire broke out.
She won't like this.
You seem depressed.
Where's the dining car?
Our feud traces back to our childhood.
You have to eat before you go.
He's not the same man he used to be.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
How do I get a hold of you?
Please get in.
We talk all the time.
I forgot to lock the door.
That's what I thought you said.
I'd like to offer you a job.
I can't remember the combination.
Don't give up.
We can't trust anyone now.
He is the father of three children.
Who said I stole the money?
What are you frightened of?
Pork doesn't agree with me.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
I don't have any time to watch TV.
I'll go first.
You should have been more careful.
Don't forget to put on some sunscreen.
You have everything.
I tricked you.
Money is everything.
I'd be much obliged if you could give me a lift into town.
We're sinking.
I did what I had to do.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom tells you.
I can see the top of the mountain.
It's a Chinese company.
Spouses are also welcome.
Did you understand any of that?
I'll show my album to you.
I've come a long way.
His story sounds true.
Give Tom what he wants.
Are you really sick?
I couldn't catch what he said.
I suppose you think I'm nuts.
Tom sorted his laundry.
I finally overcame my shyness and asked him out on a date.
How dare you speak to me like that!
I've just eaten so I'm not hungry.
I'm proud of you all.
He gave me clothes as well as food.
I thought you might want this back.
You gave me your word.
I brought you this.
I'll wait another five minutes.
She looked him straight in the eyes.
I think we'd better take a break.
Come over.
What are you doing tonight, Tom?
You will never get far without the co-operation, confidence and comradeship of other men and women.
Let's measure how tall you are.
I outrank you.
She wanted to be alone.
Turn it up.
Tom scored a goal.
Her only wish was to see her son one last time.
Leave my house.
Don't sit on that bench.
People have the right to defend themselves.
They planned their first vacation.
I speak for all people.
That's just what we need.
That doesn't work at all.
In case of an earthquake, turn off the gas.
I wish I had time for a girlfriend.
Get to the point.
Whose bike is this?
You must not touch the paintings.
I just want to be clear.
A man called on you last night.
They are all alike.
I was naive.
I am going to write a letter tomorrow.
Why do you need them?
I'd like to have dinner with you sometime.
I think you look hot.
I would like to meet you.
I fully agree with all of you.
She's upset right now.
Give me a break.
How do you know they're looking for us?
This sofa can seat three people easily.
Could I do it?
I've loved you since I first met you.
If you forget to take your pills for one day, take two pills the following day.
He paid 1,000 yen for this book.
Tom's cat had nine kittens.
This is a comfortable chair.
She has a real knack for getting people to do what she wants.
Eat your vegetables.
How did I miss this?
Diplomatic relations have not yet been established between Japan and North Korea.
I'll call if I find anything.
The boys played in the mud.
I must admit that I don't like contemporary music much.
I think we can help each other.
Are you ready for the next problem?
All the boys in class worked hard.
Haven't you caused enough trouble already?
Her composition was free from mistakes.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
When your husband finds out, he won't be happy.
I feel sick every morning.
It's back to square one.
Bring me today's paper, please.
We hurried, so we didn't miss the last bus.
I like hanging out here.
Tom told the children many stories.
It's no concern of mine.
We can't live even one more day without water.
They took a walk.
What a wonderful gift!
Dolphins are playful animals.
Don't stare at me like that.
Tom has more than thirty pairs of shoes.
She might have been beautiful when she was young.
Take the money and run.
It's a good start.
The child is sleeping on his stomach.
You deserve a prize.
She hardly talks at all.
She betrayed you.
You don't even know how.
The water is good.
I really should be going.
Can I use my credit card?
Everybody looked up to him.
He writes a daily journal, and that inspired me to try doing the same thing, but in English.
Go ahead. I'll meet you downstairs.
Stop treating me like a child.
I'm unconvinced.
He saw that he was wrong.
Does she have a piano?
Are you in trouble?
Tom currently lives with his uncle.
I'm not sure.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I bought the same camera as you have.
How fast can you do it?
He was nearly drowned.
Tom is obliged to do that.
I'm sure I've seen him before.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
I really appreciate your coming.
It wasn't easy for him to keep his promise.
Who is the woman whose picture is on your desk?
I really am very thirsty.
I'd like to be friends.
We can talk on the way.
I've got plenty of friends.
I prefer plain materials.
I was detained.
I love this game.
You should have consulted me first.
He knows that you know.
It was very sensible of him to reject the bribe.
He hurt his knee when he fell.
Can you tell the difference?
I'd like to do some traveling.
Do you know whose car that is?
Don't be so negative.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
Tom has asked us to do that.
We will only consent on that condition.
Are you sure you can handle this?
I have some things in the hotel safe.
I don't think Tom is listening to me.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
You must steer clear of that gang.
Do you want to be rich?
I thought you had all the answers.
This is all he has to do.
It is already eleven.
I'm longing to see him.
Tom could never make me laugh the way you do.
I have done the best I could to help you. The rest is up to you.
Tom paused to catch his breath.
Are they satisfied?
Don't make me do this.
You should not break your promise.
I have everything here that I need.
Are you talking to me?
Get into your car.
He's stronger than me.
Go home. Get some rest.
Tom doesn't have a date for the Saturday night.
We can't do this without you.
Will you turn on the TV?
I'm better than him.
We're going upstairs.
We ran a hundred-meter dash.
How could you agree to doing that without consulting me?
I like walking around barefoot.
Father is in his office.
Do you think Tom can find it?
I wonder why tennis is played in mini-skirts.
He swallowed his pride.
He will make a business trip to London next week.
We were surprised to hear the news.
I'm not the one who should be doing this.
Is it harder to forgive or to forget?
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
He demanded that I should pay the money back at once.
I woke you up.
He arrived at the station out of breath.
We often went skiing in the winter.
You're arrogant.
You can't blame this on us.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
I want to ask you one last favor.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
It's a matter of priorities.
What should we do with this?
She was livid when she found out all the lies he'd told her.
I bought a bottle of beer at the liquor store.
She made him a new suit.
I dipped my finger into the honey.
What are you going to do this evening?
He treats me like a child.
I want to trust you.
Get out of the way.
Something has happened to my car.
Have you seen the dog? He wandered off a couple of minutes ago.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.
I like watching movies in French.
It's brand new.
I don't feel like eating sushi.
Should I feel bad?
Let go of my arms.
I'll attend.
I want to stay a few days.
I'd like a glass of beer.
They're not home yet.
Will you help me with my homework?
She seems to be happy.
I saw him crossing the street.
In fact, he loves her.
I didn't know Tom hated me so much.
They assigned the task to us.
Why didn't you listen to me?
You should've phoned.
Where are your suitcases?
Tom showed me Mary's picture.
Two glasses of orange juice, please.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Have a nice weekend!
The athletes trained hard every day to be at their best for the Summer Olympics.
They despise you.
Tom closed his eyes.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
I wake him up at 6 every morning.
Can you tell us what the bank robber looked like?
Tires wear down because of friction between the rubber and the road surface.
We all like him.
He's pushing fifty.
The average height of the girls in class is over 155 centimeters.
He had the nerve to take my car without asking.
We don't like our neighbors, and they don't like us, either.
They're waiting for you.
She scared the cat away.
What's a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this?
Tom isn't busy right now.
It looks like snow.
OK, let's assume you're right.
He hugged her.
I didn't sleep at all last night.
I bet he will get mad.
I wanted to retire three years ago.
I felt somebody pat me on the shoulder.
I've already fed the baby.
She is in low spirits today.
I'm sincere.
Tom has no insurance.
It's a happy thing.
Had I known the truth, I would have told it to you.
I wish you were here with me now.
This is a great theory.
His business is growing rapidly.
I've been saying that all along.
I must return his call.
Ask Tom to explain it.
What a nice thing to say!
Tell me how to play the game.
I'm interested in Japanese history.
Does she play the piano?
The king's son was kidnapped.
I'll leave no stone unturned to find out who did this.
I take my hat off to you.
You're the one who trained me.
Drink a lot of water.
He robbed me blind.
It's so exciting.
The door doesn't lock.
I pay taxes.
How about running?
Do you spend most of your time worrying about things that don't matter so much?
What's this?
If you don't go, I will not go either.
I'm done listening to you.
I didn't know where else to go.
You're lucky you didn't die.
I can speak English.
You never tell me anything.
They are about to start.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
Tom tried to open the door.
Tom pushed me into the pool, so I got out and pushed him in.
Tom died when he was 97.
Remove the chicken's giblets before cooking.
I think we should all go outside.
We are responsible for your protection from now on.
It's about the size of an egg.
I was born there.
I don't think I've ever eaten anything that you would consider disgusting.
We didn't see anybody.
I always feel blue on Mondays.
What insects have you eaten?
We have other priorities at the moment.
It's a stupid tradition.
I'd like a little privacy.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
I think you've got what I need.
The program starts at nine o'clock.
We are very similar.
Why are you sitting there?
The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates.
I have never drawn anything in my life.
I don't have a guilty conscience.
She wears heavy makeup.
Bring it to me.
You're making a terrible mistake.
I hope this fine weather holds.
He's cleaning his rifle.
You should spend a little time each day reviewing vocabulary.
I have absolutely no idea when I'm supposed to do that.
Does the end justify the means?
I give you my permission to do whatever you want to do.
I forgot my manners.
You've got to be bold!
I would like to go to Austria to study music.
I guess it's OK.
We're always looking for new volunteers.
Tom died with a knife in his back.
We'll all be there together.
You won't believe this.
I've been working here for several years.
I never go on vacation without my cellphone.
She had a narrow escape yesterday.
He missed the train by one minute.
I had to look after you.
I read books.
I saw her last week.
He transferred his office to Osaka.
I am interested in English.
He knows how to cheat people.
I don't see anybody else around here.
I picked the lock.
I met her by chance on a train.
Be serious.
He has done it before.
I'm not worried about them.
Thanks.
Not much money is required.
Who kissed Tom first, Mary or Alice?
How much is this dress?
My father often falls asleep while watching TV.
He scrunched down in his seat so that I wouldn't see him.
I was hired.
I can't run as fast as he can.
She was envious of her cousin's success.
We've only got three more days.
I got really hungry.
I noticed a change.
She took the book back to the library.
I don't think I can help you.
I hate you.
Tom and Mary went on a shopping spree.
I didn't know Tom could play the trombone so well.
Tom is the star of the show.
We all laughed.
Fate taught me a hard lesson.
Tom listened with interest.
Selling cars is my business.
The greatest happiness lies in freedom.
I talked on the phone.
I really am very busy.
How are you feeling tonight?
The U.S. incarceration rate is the highest in the world.
I was in bed by nine.
First we'll eat, and then we'll go.
Everyone quieted down.
I used to be the same age as you.
You must be terrified.
She felt like crying.
Don't touch this!
I'm going to protect you, Tom.
He handed over all his property to his son.
I'd like to rent your most inexpensive car for a week.
It'll be easy.
There are several ways to measure speed.
The baby was crying to be fed.
I think it's time for me to retire.
You're articulate.
I read your letter to my family.
I know Tom is done.
He blew on the tip of his fingers.
Let us help you do that.
Her friends waited for her by the gate.
Tom is a very dangerous man.
Are you feeling under the weather?
We stayed home because of bad weather.
I forgot to do what Tom asked me to do.
Am I speaking too quickly?
I would like it if we could spend more time together.
I like the way you look.
Here's one of my favorites.
How good are you?
She is looking for her car keys.
There is no need to take his advice if you don't want to.
The older we grow, the poorer our memory becomes.
I stayed up all night.
I need the keys.
Everyone will be happy.
You'll find a solution, I'm sure.
This book is a fascinating read.
Have you ever grown a beard?
I can't do this anymore.
The competition is fierce.
He's doing it right.
I've got two brothers.
Tom sat alone with a half-empty bottle of wine.
Do you have someplace to stay?
What's your friend's name?
Do you have a recent photo of yourself?
I saw the movie on video.
Are you a member of this crew?
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
I have seen him once on the train.
That's clearly not true.
I'll tell you why I don't like Tom.
She was there in the morning.
No one knows his name.
Do what you have to do.
That's a boat.
The children are asleep upstairs.
Please help yourself to some fruit.
Tom rejected the offer.
Tom tried to drown himself in his bathtub.
It wasn't that big.
Are you sure?
She advised him to walk instead of taking a bus.
I never thought they would accept me.
You are my hero.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't be able to earn more than thirty dollars an hour.
She couldn't convince him to give a speech.
Clearly you're not interested.
Could you send someone up for my bags, please?
He combined two ideas into one.
Stay calm.
That's a good reason.
The dress in the window caught my eye.
Tom didn't know Mary was dating John.
Tom never gave up.
I'm all packed and ready to go.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
Her sudden departure surprised us all.
She laid her baby on the bed.
Marika translated my book into German.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
They joined forces and fought the enemy.
I am American.
I'm waiting to see if it's true.
How thrilling!
Is that better?
Did you watch TV last night?
You guys having fun?
You're opportunistic.
I figured it wouldn't hurt to wait for a few more minutes.
I don't even know where to look.
It'll never work.
I need more.
Do you realize how late it's gotten?
When will we arrive in Boston?
We're all being manipulated.
There was something.
No one knows.
He bit his lip.
I really appreciate your company.
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
I didn't deserve to go to prison.
Please air the futon.
They were all teachers.
I'll be late.
Let me handle it.
This milk has a peculiar taste.
I hate hospital food.
The soldiers obeyed their commander without question.
It's not a bad thing.
Who's there?
I'm wondering if I love her.
This is my father's.
When spring comes, they dig up the fields and plant seeds.
I'm sorry about last night.
Tom wasn't my husband at that time.
I think Tom could learn a lot from you.
They don't listen to me.
If I've misjudged you, I'm terribly sorry.
He's a comedian.
When did you get back from Boston?
Tom doesn't really understand French.
Tom always takes notes in class.
She advised him to see a lawyer.
My father hasn't gone abroad even once.
The same holds true for Germany.
You must go at once.
I want to know what's going on.
Are you that stupid?
He just arrived.
I always make it a point to paint things as they are.
It would be good to sleep, even for just a little bit.
The apple was cut in two by her with a knife.
I will choose one of them.
I mistook him for my brother.
Her daughter is sick.
Where are we now?
Please come here between two and three this afternoon.
What year were you born?
You are a good cook, aren't you?
Tom has never seen Mary dance.
I took control of the situation.
You may as well get used to it.
I want to be involved.
I want to press charges.
We're tired.
I'd like to watch that movie again.
I am sure that you will be satisfied.
He was reading a newspaper.
Yesterday, I put honey in my tea.
She handed him the key.
Once upon a time, there lived a poor man and a rich woman.
His family didn't have much money.
I'll take a glass of champagne.
We took a walk along the river.
My brother is a freshman.
I know that it is highly unlikely that we'll be able to sell all this stuff.
The customer is not always right.
We drove into the night.
Our passports were all we needed.
She's an intelligent young woman.
You don't owe anybody anything.
He lives in an enormous house.
Is there a flight in the morning?
I have a lot of work still outstanding.
My dad loses his keys at least once a week.
That wouldn't be any fun.
Everyone is tired.
We spoke briefly.
I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday.
I haven't told the kids yet that we're getting divorced.
I first met Tom when I was a little kid.
Did I miss the turn?
When would you like to see him?
Why couldn't I be the one to help you?
He was hard to please.
Stay calm.
They finished building the bridge on time.
How come you didn't call me last night?
That's not your job.
I meet him from time to time.
As for me, I am not satisfied with the result of the examination the other day.
I made a complete fool of myself.
Would you mind coming earlier next time?
Will you teach me how to play chess?
Tom says that's a lie.
Tom is an orphan.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
Cockfighting is banned in many countries.
We need something a bit more subtle.
What did you think I was going to suggest?
A cry arose from the crowd.
I believe I am in the right.
I was mentally and physically tired.
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
You are hilarious.
Keep your dog chained up to the tree.
They've had plenty of time.
I'm not offended.
Why are you alone?
I know his real name isn't Tom.
You're not safe there.
I have just what you need.
If you want something done, ask a busy person to do it.
I didn't know about his plan.
The door remained closed.
Show me how to do it.
Wipe your eyes.
How long did you stay at the party?
Tom expected to leave early in the morning, but he overslept.
We walked to my room.
The petals floated on the surface of the water.
They asked me for something to drink.
They made fun of my clothes.
You don't need me anymore.
I'd like to join you.
I care about all of you.
I dream about you every night.
I give you enough money every month to pay all your bills.
The floor must be kept clean.
I don't wear glasses anymore.
We have run out of sugar.
What exactly happened?
I liked your dancing.
He sounds very immature.
My uncle lives next to the school.
It is their only choice.
I think we're out of gas.
You should lower your standards.
I told everyone to be careful.
Thank you for doing that for me.
I don't know where that came from.
Tom hasn't finished his homework yet.
She used to be a very shy girl.
Where are my books?
It was late, so I went home.
The three were arrested.
Sorry to trouble you, but can you help me?
Which of you will go?
Who was the book written by?
Some people are nicer than others.
I still have a lot of time for fun.
He's annoying.
It's non-refundable.
The ice melted into a puddle of water.
Tom may eat whatever he wants to.
We heard the door shut.
You're clever.
He asked for the money.
What do you think of these?
I went to the scene of the crime.
He's a bit naive.
Don't be disgusting.
I don't get it.
You seem pretty calm about it.
The stream is not very swift.
He got kicked off the team.
Money rules the world.
I needed your help on something, but I couldn't find you.
You're bossy.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
We can't do this without some help.
That didn't help.
Give me a break.
He is ashamed of his failure.
He came after you left.
Everyone was alert.
I want to see you in my office this afternoon.
Don't break my heart.
I really do need your help.
Her hair is long and beautiful.
We know all about you.
I'd like to take advantage of this opportunity.
Let's pitch the tent while it's still light.
We can handle that.
That's just what we need.
Let's pull an all-nighter.
I never touched Tom.
Give me half of it.
I never thought about it before.
I know how busy you've been.
I'll get rid of them.
You sound tired.
Everyone except me knew what was going on.
I saw him naked.
Even Tom is a little surprised.
He is not altogether wrong.
Are you happy?
He said he would give us his decision for sure by Friday.
They want peace.
Whereabouts did you say this happened?
She is around twenty years of age.
It's a wonder they're still awake.
You'll change your mind.
I'm used to working all night.
I am happy with my girlfriend.
I don't believe this is really happening.
Tom's bored.
Can you watch my dog while I’m away?
He didn't attend the meeting.
I really wish you hadn't done that.
Our city is getting bigger and bigger.
I'll be right outside.
Sometimes things that happen do not make sense.
I've seen a lot of him recently.
I hope this data is wrong.
I don't want to ask you anything.
I lost my dog.
I promise you I'll keep you safe.
That shouldn't be hard for you.
She wriggled her toes.
Tom helped you, didn't he?
It is completely out of the question.
Would you buy that?
I wouldn't do that without you.
I think that's the point.
That's not so important.
I'm going to Izu over the weekend.
Sometimes it seems that everybody hates me.
How much money do you need?
That's not what I want.
I want to apologize to all of you for what just happened.
Why do people do this?
Speaking English is not easy.
That's totally irresponsible.
Many people are suffering from hunger around the world.
We'll figure something out.
I'm working on it.
We talked about it all night.
As is often the case with young men, he does not pay much attention to his health.
They're students.
You ought to know better at your age.
I swallowed a bug.
I went to your school.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
They ate and drank wine.
Have you eaten your lunch yet?
You're no longer welcome in my house.
Tom is not playing by the rules.
He occupies a prominent position in the firm.
We could all be dead tomorrow.
What medications are you taking?
They're just students.
My mother likes tulips very much and so does my sister.
You're lucky that you have a job.
You'd best be home before midnight.
Do I know you?
Tom will die in prison.
The last time I went to the beach, I got badly sunburned.
I want to help you figure this out.
He started washing his car.
I wash clothes by hand.
Please drop it in the mail if it's not out of your way.
I wanted to go outside and get a breath of fresh air.
Keep focused on your work.
Have you told everyone where the meeting will be?
You're conscientious.
Tom never talks about his family.
Tell me where you've been.
That was a good idea.
He worked from nine to five.
Do you have to do this every time?
Tom rolled down the window.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Tom is doing very well so far.
Do you have any tickets left?
Think of your brother.
I would tend to agree with that.
What's making this sound?
Cats are smarter than you think.
Have a nice day.
I've been following you.
Tom didn't know what else to do.
I'll get this.
Those dogs are big.
Nothing but peace can save the world.
He won the third prize.
That's absolutely right.
I was unprepared.
What kind of fruit do you want?
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
You are completely wrong.
You have a lot of books.
Could you tell me your name again?
This isn't fun. This is boring.
I think you did it.
He easily gets angry.
He drinks too much beer.
Why are you irritated?
Hurry up, guys.
All I want to do is finish what I started.
May I call you tomorrow?
You can't handle this alone.
I can't get in touch with him yet.
Fortune smiled on him.
You gotta get more organized.
You're not a city girl, are you?
What was the score at halftime?
There's no point in asking me for money.
Are you mentally ill?
That boy showed no fear.
You can't have understood what he said.
I'm too tired to drive.
Nobody answered my question.
I'd like a twin room, please.
That's what we all thought.
We are talking about our friends.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
When did you start studying Latin?
My mother always gets up earlier in the morning.
I'm always careful.
I started this topic.
Tom is already here.
Are you willing to help?
Do you need anything else?
They kicked him out of the disco without any explanation.
Is your watch correct?
We must retreat.
Seal the room.
Far from being a failure, it was a great success.
How many years did Tom spend in Boston?
If the phone rings again, I plan to ignore it.
She was shocked when she heard his story.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Tom should have done things differently.
Are you sure you can handle this?
You know very well what I want.
Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
I want you to do something about it right away.
I didn't work yesterday.
Tom has a beard.
This one's a little harder.
Didn't you go out?
When we're together, I don't worry about the future.
I'm the one who punched Tom.
His work is washing cars.
You're incredibly talented.
It's gotten better.
I put it in the drawer.
I have enough money to buy it.
He must find work.
You must not be late for school.
You will need a bodyguard.
You are, hands down, the biggest idiot I've ever met.
I feel cold. Do you mind closing the window?
I like you.
We can still get there on time.
It's a complete disaster.
I like this.
No one will talk.
She's about the same height as you.
I didn't look at Tom.
Did you practice the piano this morning?
I don't wish to anger you.
This stone is too heavy to lift.
I couldn't finish it.
I'd like to speak with Tom in private.
Lemons contain citric acid.
This girl is driving me crazy.
He spoke with a typical Texan drawl.
We've been friends.
She mended her socks.
They went crazy.
We don't like violence.
When a native speaker tries to help me sound more like a native speaker, I'm thankful.
I know what they're like.
Let's all take a deep breath.
Our allies are weak.
Would you say they match?
I'm not good at public speaking.
That's what I'm supposed to be doing.
I only found out about that today.
Why do you keep giving him money?
Did I embarrass you?
You need to be prepared.
Do you enjoy talking?
They were afraid of being overheard.
He died suddenly.
The college accepted him as a student.
Will it fit?
They kidnapped me, drugged me, and then brainwashed me.
All we need is a little patience.
Stop arguing.
Have they spotted you?
We want to make everybody happy.
You can't run from the past.
She was able to kill two birds with one stone.
Not everyone got along.
Would you slow down a little?
Why do you need a doctor?
He knows nothing about politics.
I want to show you something.
A river runs down through the valley.
They were satisfied with the meals.
Your mother and father are dead.
Was that an insult?
Nobody can believe in you more than yourself.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
Let me show you how we do that.
We should obey the rules.
I fell down the stairs in my haste.
I'm not one of them.
The celebrations culminated in a spectacular fireworks display.
Let me see the pictures you took in Paris.
I hate studying.
I met my friend on the street.
That's the one thing I'm sure of.
Nothing in the world is stronger than the will to survive.
I think we need to postpone the meeting.
The man couldn't so much as write his own name.
No one cares about us.
Who are you there with?
I don't think it's true.
Suni is playing.
I live in the house.
I'd be delighted to sing for you.
France was at war with Russia.
I could've gone last week.
She studies hard.
What wonderful weather!
Have you ever ridden a mule?
It's freezing outside.
Mary looked at herself in the mirror.
Tom made that himself.
It's her word against his.
You want to go out for a drink?
I'm going to the supermarket to do some shopping.
I only have eyes for you.
Let's bounce.
Come on, Tom. Let's go home.
I am a professor.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
You're very brave.
I just want to be left alone for a while.
You can't blame him.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're so predictable.
My husband's going to kill me.
The ship was flying the American flag.
I'm very happy to be back home.
I will bring it right away.
Tom told me not to say anything to you.
I actually had fun tonight.
According to my calculation, she should be in India by now.
It's difficult to peel chestnuts.
I write poetry in my free time.
I saw her just the other day.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'm still busy.
He won't leave me alone.
I don't have any sisters.
That was a sign.
You seem happy.
He did it for the money.
Do we need to wait for her?
I can't find my purse.
I have just what you need.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
I'm surprised to see you.
I want to fight.
Don't forget the fact that smoking is bad for your health.
I have to finish what I started.
Tom also likes to play the flute.
I haven't yet eaten anything today.
Write in the date yourself.
I'm super hungry.
Were you out last night?
He missed the deadline.
Have you seen my suspenders?
He demands immediate payment.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Are you really that stupid?
I sincerely hope not.
Tom never lets anyone do anything.
Do you know that nice-looking girl?
You don't have to be so nervous.
Why are you being so negative?
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
You're all happy.
What was Tom's reaction?
I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
He said nothing.
I'll be leaving now.
No one is talking.
I really appreciate this.
You seem busy.
Where can you get the best fresh bread?
You should take an umbrella with you this morning.
I've got a funny feeling about that guy.
Have they made progress?
Take as much time as you want.
Draw a picture of yourself.
I don't dance.
Her name slipped my mind.
A network of railroads spreads all over Japan.
Can you translate that into French?
I must remind you about your promise.
Tom saw Mary leave.
He went on doing it.
I want you to be my friend again.
I wanted you to do that.
I left Tom three messages.
It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature.
Have yourself a drink.
Are you going to vote in the upcoming election?
The children are playing outside.
I'm disappointed in you.
I was excited by the challenge.
You'd better hand that over.
I can't let you do that.
How are you feeling tonight?
Forget it.
Tom's younger brother is dating Mary's older sister.
School starts in September in Europe.
I do not feel like doing it.
Is it yours?
The meeting was almost over.
I enjoy traveling.
I want you to do it at once.
I've been very busy since this morning.
All of us went to the theater to see a play.
You're very understanding.
I believe this is mine.
Don't make me do it again.
I'm the quarterback of the team.
The plane took off at 2:30.
You're very flexible.
I did something similar.
I think you deserve more than this.
I expected him to fail the exam.
Would you like to switch seats?
You look like you've just lost your best friend.
Can you break a 1,000 yen bill?
I have urgent matters to attend to.
Don't go near the dog.
It was obvious that he was lying.
Commit these words to memory.
The boy fell off the bed.
I want to learn French.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
I don't know how you did it, but you did it.
A father and son represent two generations.
He said nothing, which made her angry.
We were able to see the sunset from our window.
He threw in the towel.
I had a nagging sensation that I'd seen him somewhere before.
When are you going to finish this?
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
That's good for a first try.
Could you send it to this address?
Have you seen the uncensored version?
He'll be sure to smell a rat if I'm with you.
Tom has donated a lot of money to various charities.
Why don't you do that by yourself?
Would you like to join us for dinner?
Keep your coat on.
Why are you all here?
I agree with what Tom said.
Laughter is like a windshield wiper. It can't stop the rain, but it lets you move ahead.
Forget it!
Did you get fired from your last job?
Having lived in Tokyo, I know the city well.
Tom won't remember a thing.
You should assume that Tom already knows about the problem.
That assumption is wrong.
You won't be shot.
I live in a two story house.
What did you do to my phone?
It's a pleasure to be here.
I'm going to need your help.
I bought a newspaper written in English.
Are you a cop or something?
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
The coffin was loaded into the hearse.
Not all people like dogs.
You'd better consult the doctor.
What are they doing here?
Do you know who wrote this novel?
Can you determine what happened?
He showed his photograph album to me.
She sat surrounded by her grandchildren.
We had to stop.
I'm busy getting ready for tomorrow.
Whatever happened to your pride?
Stand where you are!
I don't really like you.
She wanted to have her father's love to herself.
You should ask your parents for permission.
Tell me how you solved the problem.
I thought you'd gone home.
I just wanted to see what would happen.
I haven't slept well recently.
The US is trying to extradite a drug lord from Mexico.
Where is your luggage?
He found her irresistible.
That country has a trade surplus. It exports more than it imports.
Be merciful.
His clothes are worn out.
We are looking forward to seeing you soon.
I only have one suggestion.
That's a good idea.
Are you enjoying the play?
What time is sunset?
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
It's too cold.
What prevented you from coming earlier?
I'm sloshed.
He hung a picture on the wall.
Empty your pockets!
That's important.
I am a housewife.
Who knows that?
He is powerful.
Come on, try again.
Nothing is more important than empathy.
Let me carry your suitcase for you.
Are you at work?
Some of them were wounded.
I figured I might be able to help.
If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life.
I can't do what they do.
I want to find out what Tom did yesterday.
Where's the original?
How could I lie to you?
Tom dug a hole in the sand.
I don't want my mother to worry.
She sent me a present in return for my advice.
I'm just glad everything worked out.
I am very interested in music.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
They aren't the kind of people you should want to be friends with.
I reacted instinctively.
This party is kind of boring, don't you think?
Do you know me?
How did you get here so fast?
Do you want him?
She's collecting material for a book.
The light bulb burst.
I found him a job.
I guess that's the solution.
Stop singing that song.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
The cuffs of his suit jacket are badly frayed.
I can't help it.
Tom is kidding.
The problem was too much for me.
Let's discuss it now.
This just happened to me.
The meeting was almost over.
He made up his mind to go there.
She's my type.
Make certain where the emergency exit is before you go to bed at a hotel.
Do you speak French, too?
Stay out of trouble.
You know what they can do, don't you?
You're mistaken.
I guess we were happy back then.
His height is a great advantage when he plays volleyball.
She kissed my cheek.
Why don't you loosen up?
Nothing was wrong.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Sit wherever you like.
There is nothing more important than friends.
The effects are reversible.
You're not alone.
He remembered that Room 418, a very small room, was empty.
Please put out your cigarettes before entering the museum.
I have to write a letter. Do you have some paper?
Many English words are derived from Latin.
How old are your kids?
Do you have earrings on?
Tom can get in touch with Mary by email.
I am able to swim across the river.
You're perfectly right.
Please tell me where the police station is.
You're irresistible.
I know a man who can speak Russian well.
He made mistake after mistake.
What's your plan?
There's hardly any water in the bucket.
You should spend more time studying than you do.
I am not in the least surprised.
I thought you'd gone home.
It's going to take a few days.
Do you know something I don't know?
My sister has a piano.
I like your car.
I am much obliged to you for your help.
Do you have a tattoo?
He is studying history at the university.
I'm well.
Thank you for inviting me to dinner.
Is this store open on Sundays?
Every season is different.
He reached out for the sugar that was on the other table.
Tom speaks to his father in French and his mother in English.
Would you like to go camping with us next weekend?
Just tell Tom to leave me alone.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Don't let anyone enter the room.
Don't watch too much TV.
Hamlet is a play by Shakespeare.
I'm willing to try eating anything you eat.
Did they say what happened?
Let me paint you a picture.
How can you even ask that question?
He seems to make nothing of it.
I was speaking with Tom.
English is not my first language.
I'm not worried about him.
She caught a cold last night.
She's not a child.
I met him then for the first time.
I will teach you how to play chess.
I'm starting to feel desperate.
The girls won.
Everyone is proud of you.
I appreciate your suggestion.
I want a refund.
Are you really going to let Tom go there by himself?
I was totally isolated.
I want my bicycle back.
I came upon a rare stamp at that store.
She did her best to help him.
Please give him a call.
My alarm didn't go off this morning.
I despise you.
Can I give you a bit of advice?
I let you down.
Are you close to your parents?
I wish you success in your work.
I nearly died.
The party's over.
Tom eventually confessed.
The tree stopped growing.
I don't want this shirt.
Make some noise!
He was very kind to them.
Let's clear this up right now.
I expect that Tom will pass the exam.
I ate too much last night.
I don't think you really believe that.
I want to cook for you.
At our company, the retirement age is 60.
Tom has a plan, right?
He had been ill for a week when they sent for a doctor.
Everybody panicked.
Babies cry when they are hungry.
Do you take me for a complete beginner?
Let's find out where Tom went.
Your performance was very good.
Were you there?
She likes cooking for her family.
Don't attack me.
I'm feeling low.
Tom has lived in Boston for three years.
He ran to catch up to his brother.
I think love doesn't exist.
I immediately stopped laughing.
I haven't read any of his novels.
They knew exactly what they were doing.
Tom has never met Mary.
The couple broke off their engagement.
It's very sticky.
In case of a fire, use the stairs.
You should go home now.
Hug Tom.
I feel like going to the movies.
Cheese is made from milk.
He is my boss.
I'm not so sure anymore.
This is a friend of mine.
Would you like me to go there with you?
I didn't write that letter.
I don't feel like talking.
Is flight 23 on time?
You could have told me.
Does this actually make you happy?
What were you dreaming about?
I don't remember it.
I was searching for food.
Even though he was sick, he went to school.
You're back again.
They showed me a lot of nice pictures.
He took pictures of me with his camera.
Do you remember how we met?
Is anybody home?
Did they go to the mountains?
My premonition turned out to be right.
He was killed in the earthquake.
She pressured him to quit.
Are you listening to me?
Do not fear the unexpected, but be prepared for it.
Primitive calculating machines existed long before computers were developed.
I don't have a washing machine.
Let's talk about your childhood.
I think you should quit.
I bought a new computer last month.
We're still underage.
I have difficulty breathing.
These questions can be answered quite simply.
Without further ado, let me introduce tonight's guest.
We're tired.
I thought we were going to your place.
I enjoy doing that.
My boy can't do addition properly yet.
The cost of living has gone down.
Tom doesn't have a job.
She was engaged as an interpreter.
Are you a typist?
The contestant made two false starts.
Say hello to your sister for me.
She fell on her face.
He shot at the bird, but missed it.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
He put his tools away after he had finished.
You're so sweet.
This egg is fresh.
I figured that would make you laugh.
I've only seen him once.
Yakitori is a Japanese food.
You can't be in two places at once.
Please be careful.
She is obstinate.
Tom has an iPhone.
I'm not talking to Tom.
We enjoyed skating.
Are you as tall as me?
Tom opened the safe.
I think it's a little too cold to go on a picnic.
Shall we go and eat?
Give me thirty seconds.
There is no reason for her to scold you.
All the buses are full.
Roosevelt and Willkie discussed the situation.
Please wait five minutes.
It's fun to travel.
I forgot all about it.
I'm looking forward to meeting you all after such a long time.
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
Give me a ring if you find out anything.
There are three of us.
Let's talk man to man.
Do you have an alarm clock in your room?
The farmer plowed his field all day.
Please don't die!
The rest doesn't matter.
I had no idea you felt that way.
I've found something I'd like to show you.
He is not as smart as his older brother.
Plants require CO2 to grow.
I think you might need me.
When you said you'd look after Spot, you knew there'd be responsibilities.
I burned them.
If you don't keep the silverware polished, it'll lose its luster.
Do not touch the exhibits.
I had a seizure.
I bet stuff like this doesn't happen to Tom.
I'd rather be a bird than a fish.
His car was seriously damaged.
As we ate our meal, we talked about what we had done that day.
No one will believe you.
She spoke out strongly against cruelty to animals.
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
The children are riding their bikes.
You can't be sure of that.
I locked the door.
It is evident that he has made a mistake.
He's ready to go.
I'll give you a book.
Tom is building a wall.
You've hurt me a lot.
I feel normal.
Nearly a thousand people participated in the demonstration.
What a waste of water!
Birds fly.
I want to stay outside.
Are you hiring?
The method was crude, but very effective.
I'll buy you a beer.
He will come back soon.
I'll call if I learn anything.
He climbs trees easily.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
We climbed right up to the top.
Are you a natural blonde?
There is something you must know.
Do you smell something?
This place is really beautiful.
Let me try again.
I owe him some money.
I doubt that's what really happened.
Tom plugged in the TV.
I want to buy a pair of ski boots.
Champagne, please.
I saw him there.
Her oldest daughter got married.
I look forward to our next meeting.
Lawyers and auto mechanics are the people I trust the least.
I just wanted a shoulder to cry on.
I went to the hospital yesterday.
Tom seldom goes out on Monday.
I don't expect you to understand this.
They made me go there.
That's more like it.
It takes about 15 minutes to get to my office.
I always try to eat healthy food.
How much do you feed your dog?
The students all laughed.
Tom told Mary about his imaginary friend.
I had a checkup the week before last.
It is true that he is young, but he is clever.
Are you sure you can do this?
I think I know what this is.
I know the subject well.
Do you want to go?
I want to negotiate.
How much is it per box?
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I'd like your permission to use it.
Take a look at this map.
We're all students.
She is afraid of barking dogs.
We stayed home because it was raining.
I made reservations.
He can speak Chinese a little.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
I've studied French, remember?
I'm looking for a sweater.
The book is out of print.
Tom wants to buy a new car.
I still think so.
How do you know they're looking for us?
They have no natural predators.
You're overworked.
Father is having a bath.
I could have done it by myself.
Are you all set?
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
She's Tom's sister.
Tom certainly appeared to be enjoying himself.
I'm worried about the baby.
I caught a cold, and I have a fever.
Tom keeps hanging up on me.
Bring me the Kleenex.
We have a little problem.
He has hardly any money, but he gets by.
You don't even know who they are.
The early bird gets the worm.
I had met him many times before then.
They were in the right place at the right time.
My father has a blue and gray tie.
I think it's very deceptive.
It's starting to grow on us.
Tom's deaf.
Where were you yesterday afternoon?
Tom needs us to show him the way.
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
I'd love to be able to spend less time doing household chores.
I know you've been trying to help.
Are you going to eat that?
Who made this pie?
Don't act like that.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
The restaurant is empty.
I can't remember my password.
That could come in handy.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
The baby is crawling.
I'm back in business.
That's a wise choice.
I know you don't like me very much.
They don't care.
Why did you ditch me?
I could keep it a secret.
We eat more processed food than natural food.
You're naive.
She ate her dinner.
Tom didn't know where Mary had put her suitcases.
Tom was that kind of person.
I haven't seen you in ages.
My favorite color is brown.
I'm going.
Tom is happy.
His attempt to escape was successful.
He helped me move.
Few people know how to do it.
In spite of the storm, he went out.
I'm glad you didn't call Tom.
The problem disappeared as if by magic.
Mt. Fuji is higher than any other mountain in Japan.
That's going to take time.
He has knowledge and experience as well.
You don't seem very sure.
I don't remember you asking me to do that.
She waited patiently for him.
Let me help.
I saw him in the park.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Children should be taught to share.
He needs to be alone.
This book has a lot of pictures.
Do you take travelers' checks?
I am following that car.
Who knows what's going to happen?
Would you like to be seated?
He decided not to go.
He is no longer a member of our club.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
I'd like to sail around the world.
It's not cool.
I'm not finished with you.
It is important for them to do their best.
Suddenly, it started to rain very hard.
The only golden rule is that he who has the gold makes the rules.
Tom and Mary will come at 2:30.
How many more are there?
I know I'm not a likable guy.
I've nothing to give.
Tom often goes to the movies with Mary.
I guess this desk will serve the purpose until we can get a new one.
This book is worth reading again.
She is knitting a sweater.
Last year, the company was sold to private investors.
I'm smarter than you.
Be friendly.
Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story.
I had to lend to him money.
She was voted prom queen.
Tom disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer.
You need to see this.
It didn't work out.
Insurance policies don't cover preexisting conditions.
You're very wise.
It looked real.
When you love what you do, it shows.
How about this one?
Tom's unarmed.
I didn't like my teacher.
You're in pain, aren't you?
I can't believe what an idiot I've been.
We have two daughters.
Tom persuaded Mary to go to the party with him.
I like to dream.
I want an answer from you as soon a possible.
As far as I know, he is a reliable person.
Why don't you take over?
You must take care of your dog.
Come with me now.
He's playing with my cat.
You're cantankerous.
They've crossed the border.
I forgot to ask your name.
You must be very busy these days.
Tell Tom I'll be back.
We're really good.
I have no religion.
I went to Boston for Tom.
I give you my permission to do whatever you want to do.
Can you see?
I didn't notice him go out.
Don't I have some say in this?
Did you tell Tom?
She isn't paid monthly, but daily.
She grabbed a shower.
We have two dogs. One is black and the other is white.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I'm not a doctor.
Your thirty minutes are up.
You'll be late for work.
Tom didn't help me.
She lives with him.
Tom lost his memory.
I called Tom's house, but nobody answered.
He thinks he can prove it.
Tom wasn't wearing his seat belt.
I decided not to do it.
I could never do that sort of thing.
Could you give me a discount?
You will always be welcome.
They are alone.
It's illegal to park your car here.
It doesn't bother me if you stay.
An image is worth a thousand words.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
You gotta get more organized.
There's a problem with that.
We have to move.
I may have hurt his feelings.
I haven't seen her in years.
At least for now, I'm not going to say anything.
I must finish my homework before dinner.
I've got to see a dentist.
They're free.
Please don't speak so fast.
I heard the children singing together.
We called off the wedding.
She told him that he was right.
They were beginning to lose faith in their commander.
You should have seen it!
I could find his address.
The electricity went out, but it's back on now.
He can speak both English and French very well.
Can you drive?
Where are my slippers?
Why would you do that without telling us?
Would you like to read this magazine?
He is employed in a bank.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
We moved into a new house.
The delay was unavoidable.
I'm glad to see you here.
Tom and Mary aren't coming.
Tom bent down and picked up a handful of sand.
Why are you flinching?
In those days, I made it a point to take a walk before breakfast.
We think his last name is Jackson.
I've never seen a rainbow.
I have gone astray somewhere in my calculation.
She didn't visit anybody.
I think that would be best.
I want to know what you're doing here.
We all need to stay together.
I will not let you do it.
You can fix all this.
The regulation was abolished, but then it was reenacted.
I started that.
I've never done this kind of thing before.
He is a bad driver.
I'll get in touch with you next week.
Wake me up at seven.
I was very flattered.
I'll finish it as quickly as I can.
I asked him if he would return soon.
It's your duty to finish the job.
She cried as she read the letter.
I have a dream.
That's a pretty girl.
Are you alone?
That's why I sent for you.
I like to travel alone.
They all entered.
It doesn't look that way.
We're not going to do it.
Do you like Moscow?
That's exactly what I think too.
God can be found everywhere.
We did that.
Can't you just accept that?
The wind blew her hat off.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
Do you need a ride?
Our children like dogs, but I prefer cats.
Let Tom do his job.
It's complex.
Without you, I am nothing.
He can explain the situation.
I want to prove I can do this.
If it had not been for his help, I would have failed.
I haven't eaten at my grandmother's house since I was a kid.
She regretted that she had not followed his advice.
I want to live in a castle.
It is kind of you to drive me home.
I know I'm not dreaming.
I could've met you at the airport.
Let's unfold the map on the table and discuss it.
Health means everything.
He gives plain, simple explanations.
My sons are soldiers.
Let's ask the teacher.
Can anyone help me?
She went to see him the other day.
Don't read my journal.
Please don't leave valuable things here.
I was up all night studying.
Would you please stop talking?
I spent 100 dollars today.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
That can't be Mary. She's in the hospital now.
We are expecting the publication of his book.
It is no joke.
A stranger came up to me and asked the way.
I have an identical twin.
She hung the calendar on the wall.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Everybody started cheering.
How far are you prepared to go?
What are the conditions?
Anyone who criticizes him is asking for trouble.
Tom can't leave Boston until next Monday.
Can I borrow a pen? Mine's on its last legs.
I don't feel like talking anymore.
This place was bombed during the war.
I'm not the only one who wants to go.
You're a good man.
My sister isn't used to cooking.
Maybe she is coming.
We're not ready for this.
The only thing that matters is that you are alive.
Tom and I've been discussing the situation for the past three hours.
Are you sure you can do it?
He dislikes me.
I'm delighted to be here.
I am very pleased.
I can't see my dad.
I've got a pacemaker.
Speaking Japanese is easy for me.
I have hardly any English books.
I just met him.
One is never too old to learn.
I know Tom is miserable.
Will you help me for a minute?
Tom said that Mary always does that.
You have to stay fit.
That would be unprofessional.
I realize I'm just stating the obvious.
My uncle went to Mexico in 1983, never to come back.
You're doing it right.
I rang the bell.
I could hear doors slamming.
I was a little afraid.
I just want to have fun.
I met her by chance.
I remember seeing you all somewhere.
I tried but didn't succeed.
He pocketed the company's money.
Nobody tells the truth.
Why are you angry with him?
You don't understand women, Tom.
I know it's a lie.
This isn't enough.
What's your daughter's name?
He only speaks one language.
There is usually a cool breeze here in the evening.
You'll have to take his place in case he can't come.
I didn't get the meaning.
Those are our books.
Interest rates are going up.
Tom wrote to a friend.
He does not wear a hat.
Tom is our family doctor.
I hope you stop telling me lies.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
I don't see anybody dancing.
Do you like my new haircut?
I haven't seen you for a while.
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader.
I wish I had more time to talk to you.
We talked over the plan with him.
Tom doesn't care, but Mary does.
Your hair is too long.
I was frustrated.
This is no one's fault.
I've got better things to do than to sit here listening to your gossip.
Tom and Mary don't get along.
How many times have you done this?
All humans on Earth are descended from a common ancestor.
This job shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
Brush your teeth after every meal.
Use this.
Do you really think it's bad?
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
He did not believe anyone had the right to do so.
She agreed to my idea.
The kids are driving me crazy.
We'll win.
There is no other way.
We're not happy.
It could just be your imagination.
I never forgot you.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
I think Tom believed me.
She burst into tears.
We're on the wrong train.
I didn't recognize what it was.
How much will all this cost?
A wink was his only answer.
You just made me miss the perfect shot when you hollered.
Do you work here?
He is able to speak ten languages.
Tom can speak French better than you.
I bet you're talking about Tom.
I suppose it couldn't be helped.
Sweden's population is growing.
Don't underestimate me.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
That's even better.
I'll come straight to the point. You're fired.
I have more than enough.
Can I tell you something very personal?
I realized I couldn't win.
Where did you hide it?
I don't know if I should tell him.
I admit I'm wrong.
I hope Tom and Mary don't get arrested.
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter.
That was a costly mistake.
He likes coffee without sugar.
I was in the hospital last week.
That's a sign.
Lightning struck Tom's house.
The bike's mine.
Are you Tom?
I had my radio repaired by him.
Check your pockets.
There's something I want to show you.
Your father's friends aren't his only supporters.
I am poor at swimming.
I think you look hot.
A DNA test showed he was innocent.
I haven't yet eaten anything today.
He has only six months to live.
They should have told us they were moving out.
Put that in writing.
Let Tom do his job.
Mother Teresa was a Catholic nun who lived and worked in Calcutta, India.
Make the new guy do it.
Recently, I don't have much appetite.
He was panting.
You're very open.
Don't raise your voice.
They're special.
I'm not about to ask him.
Let me think for a while.
Why do you need this money?
Smog hung over Tokyo.
I want a refund.
She is not up yet.
You'd better not do it.
Let's forget about what happened today.
Is there any coffee in the kitchen?
Did I get it right?
You have to be strong.
You can't hurt my feelings.
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
She visited him on October 20th.
He did it without me knowing.
Few students could understand what he said.
I must be going deaf.
Tom plays the piano every day.
I hate insects.
You're not going to do it, are you?
Come into my arms.
What do you think of the new teacher?
The rain lasted for three days.
He gave me an apple.
I must say I'm a bit disappointed.
I love my home.
Tell me what you see.
Apparently, the bus is late.
She suddenly kissed me.
Yesterday, I bought a red car.
Dissolve the tablet in a glass of water.
I'll expect you next week.
I am almost ready.
There's an answer to everything.
The professor smiled.
Do you have to stay?
You're my best customer.
Are you growing a beard?
You can't buy it anymore.
I've made a list of things I'd like to buy.
I'm really not supposed to do this.
I got dumped.
I can prove that I am right.
You're very busy.
Your soul needs to be saved.
If walls could talk, what stories would they tell us?
I can't sleep because of the noise.
There was nothing but an old chair in the room.
He's a real man.
I persuaded him to consult a doctor.
We have no proof.
I heard explosions.
I'm so sick of this.
She ran as fast as she was able to.
I checked Tom's computer.
I was very busy last week.
The man is right.
I suggest that you go and see a doctor about this as soon as you can.
Tom's leg is healing.
She'll probably come.
It's a dead end.
Seeing the woman with the yellow hat reminded me of a story.
What's their purpose?
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
Are you learning French?
I'm downstairs.
Forget it!
We could meet downtown. Would that be convenient for you?
Nobody knows it but me.
Would you like some coffee?
I have no idea.
Are all these books yours?
Have you ever been hypnotized?
I informed her of my arrival.
My mother's going to kill me.
When is good for you?
Did you have a good sleep?
You're nuts!
I gave orders I was to be left alone.
She will return within an hour.
She parked her car in a vacant lot.
There's almost no water in the bucket.
Don't leave the bicycle out in the rain.
I'm a little busy.
My children don't listen to me.
Can I use your phone for a sec?
I want to make this quick.
Tom and I used to be neighbors.
My aunt treats me as if I were a child.
Tom seems to be a kind person.
It was an interesting debate.
Tom doesn't know anything about that.
I am almost scared to talk with you.
You're really selfish.
There's something I have to tell you.
You may stay here if you want to.
There are six people including him.
A stranger spoke to me in the bus.
Are you excited?
Tom was in Boston last month.
You seem depressed.
I want you to tell me what to do.
She loves cooking.
Let me help you.
We'll cooperate.
You drive.
I think your hypothesis is correct.
Tom was looking at a map of the area.
What do you want to do about it?
Why didn't you call the police?
I am in charge here.
I want to know your opinion.
I don't mind even if she doesn't come.
He might change his mind.
He can't even butter his own bread.
No one knows the fact.
I must obey.
I ran like lightning.
Let's not tell anybody.
If you don't have enough money, I'll lend you some.
This is gibberish.
Rather than cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?
Are you vegetarian?
Why wouldn't you go out with him?
Their losses reached one million yen.
I was worried for nothing.
Do you even care?
The Great Lakes supply drinking water.
Stop screaming in my ears.
Don't say a word to me.
Let me introduce you to the rest of the team.
Are you studying?
Do you want to tell me what this is?
Turn on the TV.
He made mistake after mistake.
Who hired you?
Had you been drinking?
He's very young. He's much younger than Tom.
I'm going to hide somewhere near here.
It is cold there, even in summer.
I'd like to see your sister.
My uncle gave me a present.
I never told anyone.
It's a lot of fun playing outdoors.
He is running short of funds.
They kept talking all the time.
You will soon get accustomed to your new school.
What a waste of time!
I don't know what we're going to find, but we should find something.
I can come back another time.
Why is she here?
Did you meet someone else?
He lay on the bed.
One of the girls was left behind.
I'm Tom's cousin.
We're unemployed.
He's three years older than her.
This stays between you and me.
Should we worry?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to stay at home.
We're anxious.
Anybody want a lift?
I'm wealthy.
Tom could've killed you if he'd wanted to.
This English composition is far from perfect.
Tom has changed a lot since high school.
It can't wait.
I don't know what happened.
The road was very bumpy.
You could've killed somebody.
I was able to answer the question.
Stop hitting me!
I have a feeling that she will come today.
Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
I have to wear boots.
How far is it from here to the next village?
He approached the station.
Oh, don't be like that.
I only have one sister.
There is a cottage beyond the bridge.
I especially want to thank our record-breaking sales team.
Give him a hug.
Don't throw that away.
Why should we harm you?
Tom washed his hair.
It was a quiet winter evening.
Do you want to say goodbye?
The highway was blocked.
Tom is clearly lost.
I want to let go of your hands now.
It's nice to be needed.
Does anyone need a lift home?
I didn't want Tom to help me.
I've just finished breakfast.
The thief was bound hand and foot.
What's your favorite band?
I just followed the recipe.
You look nervous.
Can I touch your beard?
I want to take you to dinner.
He flatly refused to let me in.
He was born poor, but died a millionaire.
My dog often pretends to be asleep.
I was married once.
Would you like it washed?
He said the same thing over and over again.
You should have done so.
I'm an American citizen.
Have you ever seen anything like that?
What sort of things do you do on weekends?
I felt my heart beating violently.
I didn't steal it. You can check my pockets.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Your cat is overweight.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I want your name and badge number.
I've got to get to the airport.
Tom needs to know the truth.
Do you really think Tom is happy?
He got dressed and went outside.
We ought to do better.
They worked through the night.
Let's do something different this afternoon.
He is playing golf.
I doubt if it'll snow.
We'll wait here.
You don't look Japanese.
They know the truth.
Are you sure you just want water?
He told me that I should be more careful.
Can I write it that way?
I need to find out who he was.
It's very humid.
Will you have another cup of tea?
Thank you for listening.
I studied all week for that quiz.
Aren't you satisfied?
What are you all doing here?
Is anybody in there?
It's cold in here.
I'm confused now.
Don't give up the fight.
Language and culture can't be separated.
What is your number?
I live in Tokyo.
He couldn't help laughing at it.
Don't interrupt.
The bus is capable of carrying thirty people.
Try and do your homework by yourself.
Apples grow on trees.
Tell Tom I'm sorry.
I saw the movie.
The work has to be finished before noon.
I got over it. You should, too.
Let us know if you're available next week.
I want a licensed guide who speaks English.
It feels good to be back.
I don't have a sword.
She heard him scream, so she ran into his bedroom.
They agreed on everything.
Fill in the blanks.
He retired at the age of 65.
It's not quite as simple as that.
We’ve been waiting for hours.
Being very tired, I soon fell asleep.
How did you get out of your room?
I can't believe your mom made you wear that.
Let me carry it for you.
I'm not sure I follow what you're saying.
See you later.
Don't tell anybody.
He's never been in love before.
Nobody speaks to me.
That's true, too.
I let you down.
He stood up for what was right.
Stop me if you can.
Now I am too old to walk.
Do you know where your children are?
We spoke briefly.
Is there really a solution?
I thought you'd be more helpful.
I was eating lunch when the phone rang.
I thought I'd surprise you.
I can't believe I listened to you.
Bulgarian is like Russian.
Would you do it?
The students are having a recess now.
It was just a dream.
I never thought I'd be doing this alone.
Play it cool.
He was late because of the snow.
You look good in that suit.
Were your mother and father home?
Whose is it?
I agree with everything you just said.
I mean it!
I got an ink blot on this form.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
Let's go outside for some fresh air.
This word is also French in origin.
I don't suppose there's much chance of that happening.
I don't know what your problem is.
The rest doesn't matter.
The police used a battering ram to break down the door.
You're lucky you didn't die.
The upstairs window opened.
My father fixes broken chairs.
I lay on my face.
I think you have my umbrella.
Fill this out, please.
I'm sure that you'll succeed.
I left in kind of a hurry.
I'm sorry about my mistake.
I know better than to lend him money.
I am counting on you.
She is a most beautiful lady.
Is that really all there is?
Tom says he's planning to buy a gift for Mary.
She and I have about the same number of stamps.
She spends more time thinking about work than doing it.
I love the sound of rain falling.
That's one of ours.
He's on his last legs.
They were all surprised to see me there.
He stopped to smoke.
We both want to go to Boston.
You're dirty.
Here comes the train.
They were afraid of the big dog.
We miss you very much.
If you go by bus, you can get there in about one-third of the time.
I suspect you're wrong.
The electricity is off at the moment.
He gave us not only clothes but some money.
There are no problems.
I am lazy.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
Everything went black.
It is pretty cold.
He was surprised to learn this.
I want to write to Tom.
I have a vivid imagination.
My dream is to lead a quiet life in the country.
I felt fear.
That book is very old.
This is true love.
Haven't you eaten lunch?
Tom won't talk to me about it.
They've lost so much.
Unexpected stuff happens all the time.
I've been feeling bad for a week.
This is a pun.
Tom lives in a cabin in the woods.
I guess it doesn't matter anymore.
I don't like looking foolish.
"Now and then I think of divorcing him." "You must be kidding!"
It looks as if it's going to rain.
Wow! What a big box!
You don't need to wait.
He has to study hard.
Did you get in trouble with your parents?
Why would anyone do such a thing?
No one told me.
The word is unfamiliar to me.
This patient is suffering from hypoxia.
Napoleon was banished to Elba in 1814.
As far as I know, he did nothing wrong.
Is he still alive?
Do you know where I live?
Do you believe in UFOs?
The fighting lasted about three months.
I paid attention.
I never forgot you.
Can I afford it?
He made his parents happy.
I wonder why birds migrate.
Are you sure that's necessary?
I have a heart problem.
Come sit with us.
Pick one up while you can.
Save it on the external hard drive.
Her oldest son is not married.
I want the same jacket as you are wearing.
You seem happy.
We're not so sure.
I am delighted to be here.
That's embarrassing.
Over-sleeping is no excuse for being late.
Thank you for the wonderful dinner.
He was surprised by what he learned.
Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?
I had a strange experience last night.
The jury found the man guilty of murder.
Although she is rich, she dresses quite simply.
We bought a new washing machine.
I don't have a cat.
There's no more salt.
I can talk to Tom for hours.
What's in those boxes?
I know what those books are like.
I don't think I'm unimaginative.
Maybe he will arrive tonight.
Tom was guilty of spreading lies about Mary.
I want Tom to hear your story.
I'd like some time alone, please.
That must've hurt.
I found a good Mexican restaurant.
No one was punished for the fiasco.
Tom hoped that the doctors would tell him that he didn't need the surgery after all.
I want to hear more.
Tom was almost three hours late.
Did I lock the door?
She knows more than she's letting on.
Tom looked at the floor.
She's the perfect housewife.
She gave us a vague answer.
I got it free.
Where did you find that dress?
Call 1-800-828-6322 for a free brochure.
I want a massage. I need to relax.
I've been dying to see him.
Is it my turn?
Tom ran out of matches so he couldn't light the fire.
I'm undressing.
He adopted her idea.
Sometimes I get jealous.
I asked Mary to dance with me.
You hurt him.
Let me buy you a drink.
I had dinner ready for you.
I feel uneasy in my father's presence.
You have three cars.
I'll call you right after the meeting.
God made the universe.
I got lost in the woods.
I plan to finish it in two or three minutes.
I hear Tom hates you.
She is young.
I thought I heard you.
The moon circles the earth.
Tom said everything he wanted to say.
The nurse checked Tom's pulse.
Some parts of this city are very ugly.
I may have made a mistake.
We hope to reach the summit before it gets dark.
I was convicted.
He described exactly what happened.
Why didn't she help you?
There was no one left but me.
Black coats are in fashion this winter.
You can have this watch for nothing.
I'll never be able to play again.
Well done!
I think we need to postpone the meeting.
Did he show you the picture?
Are you blackmailing me?
He wants you to come home.
Her technique is superb, but she needs to play with more expression.
He has no conscience.
Maybe I need a new assistant.
I must offer you an apology for coming late.
Close all the windows.
How long have you been in this town?
That's what I'm asking you to do.
What is going on here?
I delivered a lecture in English.
My father is suffering from influenza.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
I knew you'd come back to me.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
I accused him of cheating.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I hope that's a joke.
She advised him to take better care of himself.
You need to be more patient.
Be there tonight.
Is this your car?
How much is the ticket?
What do you think the audience wants?
Did I interrupt something important?
Don't judge a book by its cover.
What exactly have you got in mind?
I was just about to leave.
All you have to do is to hand this book to him.
Tom has three sons, I believe.
I really don't get you.
I want to know where you plan to live.
Is there something in particular that you want to eat?
Tom doesn't have Mary's address in Boston, but he has her phone number.
Help us, please.
Is there anything to drink in the refrigerator?
Do you know him at all?
They both lived in Boston.
Tom closed his eyes again.
She asked him for some money.
Don't make me answer that question.
Do you think you've made the wrong choice?
Is there a gas station near here?
You had better take her advice.
I saw him wash the car.
She is shy of strangers.
I often ski.
He has enough money.
Since it was Sunday, the store was closed.
Tom is ill at ease among strangers.
I was singing.
You're very clever.
"Thanks for the help." "Don't mention it."
I can't stand his arrogance.
That is a boat.
Tom and Mary sat on the beach and talked to each other.
He knows what's going on.
He gave away all his money to charity.
I want you to find out.
Is this fish still alive?
Put that back on the table.
Let me know how it goes.
He was like a father to me.
They want to know what your plan is.
I'll write you as soon as I arrive there.
This laptop is light.
It's worth a try.
This will be one of the best memories of my life.
You must respect your elders.
He's much more into her than she is into him.
Commit these words to memory.
Come on, you can do it.
There is no more cheese left.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
It is less muggy today than it was yesterday.
I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
Tom has just resigned.
Would you like to have tea with us this afternoon?
This symphony is a real masterpiece.
Tom has gone crazy.
I've never seen a whale that big.
It's none of my business!
I always have trouble pronouncing that word.
You enjoy that, don't you?
What a pretty girl!
Tom is all alone.
You should try the exam again.
They found no such proof.
I studied a lot in school.
I want something to write on.
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
What have you come up with?
He picked up a red stone.
I like him very much.
You're not as beautiful as you think you are.
There are a lot of dustballs under the couch.
Is this the best you have?
I was working late.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I love my brothers and sisters.
It's just a phone.
So what is it you want me to do?
Tom isn't going to be happy to see me.
I'll be back before you know it.
Did you like it?
You may stay here for the night, but you'll have to leave in the morning.
Tom ran all the way home.
He has absolute power.
The nation needed more and better teachers.
We have a gig at the club tomorrow night.
How do you know what I heard?
Anyone can ask a question.
It's not a holiday.
Tom has just finished washing dishes.
I had no other way of contacting you, so I came here in person.
You're wasting my time.
How many times have you lied to me?
He likes coffee without sugar.
Mary has stopped smoking.
How many letters are there in the English alphabet?
You're all alone.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
When are you going to finish this?
He's old and ugly.
Tom can walk.
We need to cut costs.
You're not going to do it, are you?
He did it in good faith.
I'm not scared of dying.
I will have finished reading this novel by the time you come tomorrow.
I enjoyed talking with her.
Tom has a funny way of laughing, doesn't he?
Do you have difficulty losing weight?
Hurry up! If you don't, we'll be late.
What scared you?
She accused him of stealing her car.
His little brother is a famous soccer player.
It is better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
I don't watch TV.
There is a friendly atmosphere in the office.
The GDP of China still pales in comparison with that of the US.
He was caught with his pants down.
The bath was not hot enough and I was unable to enjoy it.
Come in.
He continued doing it.
Is it raining?
I think it's reliable.
Can you juggle?
He's not afraid of anyone.
Do you want this room painted, too?
That's my business.
It's not known who first invented the wheel.
You're selfish.
Did you have fun?
You will soon cease to think of her.
Television is ruining family life.
Would you consider taking care of my children next Saturday?
I often go fishing with them.
Luckily, I was wrong.
I'm going back home tomorrow.
I like lots of butter on my toast in the morning.
I know Tom really does care about you.
I haven't told the kids yet that we're getting divorced.
I can't put up with the way he spits.
He came to see me.
He was my best friend in high school.
All our plans went wrong.
Since I was sick for a week, I am making every possible effort to catch up.
You seem to be making progress.
I missed my flight.
I'm very busy so don't count on me.
Everyone was invited, except for me.
This is personal.
She kicked him.
It won't be that hard.
How do you want to handle it?
There is so much to do, and only a lifetime to do it.
Please sign your name on the contract.
I major in economics.
I want you to tell me what to do.
Take heed of her advice.
Let's take a 10-minute break.
I'll forgive you.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
He stayed at his aunt's house.
Promise me you'll be careful.
He is good at taking photos.
Why are you running?
Things took a sudden turn for the worse.
They wouldn't have done anything.
I wonder if he loves me.
Leave it to me.
I thought I heard you come in.
I didn't have to wait long.
Change your mind, if you want to.
She pooh-poohed the idea with a disdainful wave of her hand.
I don't know why you're all so jumpy.
I didn't want anyone to know I was here.
After I graduated from college, I moved back home and lived with my parents for three years.
I made a reservation at our favorite restaurant.
It happened very fast.
Your tea will get cold if you don't drink it now.
My friend likes to live in the city, but his wife prefers to live in their little cottage in the country.
Why don't you stay there?
You were hurt, weren't you?
When do you intend to start?
I want facts.
My boss isn't satisfied with my report.
He who lives by the sword will die by the sword.
How old were you when you did that?
Have you seen all these movies?
Let's pretend this never happened.
That's why I need your help.
Don't be so sensitive to criticism.
Have you already met her?
My nose was very runny.
I'll take this umbrella.
I'm fed up with English.
A fish can swim.
I'm sicker than I thought I was.
The truth finally came out at his trial.
You'll be the first to know.
I just wanted Mary to love me.
This job involves lots of hard work.
He asked if I liked Chinese food.
Don't tell me what I already know.
Can I have a moment with you?
I agree completely with you on this point.
I need you to come with me.
I'm glad you brought that up.
She didn't tell me the truth.
He is an office worker.
Are you sure about this?
I waved him back.
The keys are on the table.
He was conscious of his mistake.
Surround yourself only with people who are going to lift you higher.
He loves music.
I saw the game.
You'll never be alone.
Our children still go to school.
You all right?
I'd appreciate it if you'd come with me.
What do you want to do today?
He told me to speak more slowly.
Sorry, I'm a stranger here.
Tom was busy all day yesterday.
You couldn't possibly understand.
If the university doesn't have enough students, the administration will cancel the class.
Do you have two computers?
This room is too small for us.
He ran away as soon as he saw me.
Everything comes to those who wait.
He blames his failure on bad luck.
Why don't you come dancing with me?
It was a good choice.
What would you do if you were in my place?
This is my pencil.
Tom likes the ocean.
You should work hard.
It's a bit strange as far as I'm concerned.
Tom threw something at me and I ducked.
She has spent hours at the gym trying to lose weight.
You don't have to make a different dish for every person.
They were lucky.
I was trapped in a vicious circle.
If people who smoke are deprived of their cigarettes, they get nervous and irritable.
Do you have any idea what that is?
Do you know when Tom will get back?
It wasn't me who slammed the door.
Have they made progress?
She is powerful.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
What're you writing?
Let's try something.
I already took the pies out of the oven.
That can't be good for you.
I'm not in the mood right now.
Please stop.
I realized what was happening.
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
You can invite other people.
We probably don't have enough money to buy that.
She's about the same age as me.
How long did you stay in Canada?
It's a no-brainer.
Who was this picture painted by?
Tom refused to sign his name.
Except for leap years, February has only 28 days.
Why didn't you run away?
You can watch television after dinner.
I'd die without you.
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
He loves taking trips.
He removed his shirt.
Reservations are not required.
That makes no sense.
Tom eats a lot of Chinese food.
They danced until six in the morning.
I'm patient.
I'm in Boston all this week.
See you tomorrow.
We're stuck.
You came at the right time.
I caught Tom by surprise.
You're a very attractive woman.
We've been eating a lot of beans lately.
You can use margarine as a substitute for butter.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
She's five years younger than I am.
Nobody does that.
After we walked for a while, we got to the lake.
I felt like I was dead.
He cleared out his desk.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
May I have a look at your ticket?
You look beautiful this evening.
Do you know how fast you were going?
I can't be seen with you.
How's married life going?
Tom can't speak French. Mary can't speak French either.
I am no longer young, but I can still bite.
Does that make you feel better?
It's essential that we find them.
Let's go to lunch together.
They don't know us.
Snow covered the bus.
I want to know who your friends are.
Tom has narrow shoulders.
She whispered something into his ear.
Don't pick it up.
Have you ever seen Tom's mother?
I can't read French, nor can I speak it.
Why are there stars in the sky?
I don't think I can help you.
I'm not quitting now.
These are the originals.
My father drives a very old car.
Why wouldn't you listen to his advice?
You must be very busy these days.
You're not very tidy.
Where do the airport buses leave from?
I speak French as well as Tom does.
Not all blondes are dumb.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
Try to calm down.
For further information, see page 16.
It is just a year since I got married.
There was nothing but sand as far as the eye could see.
Where's the car?
He is a spoiled child.
I have plenty of theories.
Where does this desk go?
She turned off the lights.
Write in ink.
Tom is calling us a taxi.
Doesn't anything ever get to you?
I just want to keep things nice and simple.
He blamed me for not coming.
He sent me some American magazines.
He is here!
Are you here with anyone?
I dreamed I had been abducted by aliens.
What happens next?
I like working with you.
Get it out of the house.
Try to sleep.
His blood is boiling.
The living room in my new house is very large.
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
Did you think I was Canadian?
I really appreciate you helping me.
I'm not sure why they asked me that.
Have I lost my mind?
This melody is familiar to many Japanese.
Mary applied moisturizing cream to her face.
We should do this more often.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
I'm Tom's French teacher.
The audience gave Tom a standing ovation.
I can't believe you eat that stuff.
You don't look well.
Come on, let's do it.
I wanted you to have this.
Go and help wash the dishes.
Hello, how's business?
Tom taught me how to cook.
I'll get the car.
He likes not only baseball but football as well.
Let's continue where we left off yesterday.
I am exhausted.
He got tired of reading.
It was quite dark when I got home.
If I were in your situation, I would do the same thing.
I asked my son what he really wanted.
She got the money from him.
He is working in the field of biology.
He heard the news on the radio.
She devoted herself to him.
The result remains to be seen.
That's exactly what I did.
I didn't know what to say to him.
I no longer wish to be a part of this project.
Why didn't you shave?
That's great!
We hope this never happens again.
I should've been honest with you.
You're not dead yet.
He comes from a small but wealthy town.
I need a weapon.
I'm looking after myself.
We're comedians.
I'm not joking.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I'll ride shotgun.
You look like somebody I went to high school with.
Tom advised us not to do that.
Who's your favorite super hero?
You're worried, aren't you?
I'll make this up to you.
We had a large audience.
Can't you tell me how to do this?
It's a no-brainer.
You're making me blush.
I'm crazy about you.
I don't want us to be enemies.
All my friends are getting married.
Don't you just hate technology?
There's a scratch here. Could you give me a discount?
If you are hungry, why don't you eat?
The plants were damaged by the frost.
I think Tom is a student.
As long as you're here, I'll stay.
My college has dormitories.
Don't do that. It's not your job.
You must have women throwing themselves at you all the time.
Stay a while and listen.
What did you discover?
Try to hold it together.
A combination of several mistakes led to the accident.
There is little money left.
Please come.
Tom was arrested as a suspect in a criminal case.
I don't drink much wine.
I could hear everything.
This animal is friendly.
I'll show you the way out.
Wait, why am I telling you this?
Don't tell anyone what we're doing.
I can't remember the last time I ate with my family.
I thought you were serious.
I want every day to be as good as this one.
Don't talk about my family.
Tom isn't very funny.
Our supply of food is exhausted.
May I eat this apple?
I try to never eat after 8:00 p.m.
I was not drunk.
He fixed the net.
I'll tell you a story.
You must teach me what you know.
Tom wanted Mary to sing his favorite song.
Can you go faster?
About this time tomorrow, we'll be climbing Mt. Fuji.
What were you expecting?
I want my life back.
You're afraid that I'm right, aren't you?
She can't ski.
We can't afford to buy a new car.
Which is your target?
Things are improving.
I'm going to take a bath as soon as I get home.
I would rather stay at home than go out on such a cold day.
He gambled on the war coming to an early end.
It seems that everyone's having fun.
I'm about the same age as you are.
You're a teacher, right?
I just need a little time.
I feel like I'm a teenager again.
I'm not sure I like this.
I'm tired of keeping secrets.
Japan imports oranges from California.
Have you told her mother?
I just wanted to apologize.
We were thinking of asking you to join our company.
Clearly you're not interested.
Where did everybody go?
It was an amazing experience.
I cover twenty miles a day.
Don't think about it.
He took the job without giving it much thought.
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
What caused the explosion?
He swallowed his pride.
I've messed up.
Is it your bike?
We all consider your idea to be impractical.
I'm always moody.
He came back home a while ago.
Tom showed Mary John's photo.
I want you to tell Tom that I love him.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
It makes no sense at all.
I helped her with her work.
May I ask you a personal question?
What did it all mean?
I've been thinking about it, too.
I love you just the way you are.
I don't know for certain.
I have to put my shoes on.
Tom can get in touch with Mary by email.
My father planted this tree on the day I was born.
Last night my daughter didn't come home until half past one.
I booked a seat.
I think they know us.
I will see him after I get back.
How can you be so callous?
He has to have an operation next week.
I can't give you anything.
I'm leaving it to you.
I think I'm ready to leave.
Are you sure that's necessary?
School begins at half past eight.
I dislike cold weather.
The moment I held the baby in my arms, it began to cry.
I'm looking for a French penpal.
What is the purpose of education?
My mother took me to the park.
You're so beautiful in that dress.
I'm saving this seat for Tom.
I'm just as confused as you are.
They are approaching.
I kind of messed up.
It's just your imagination.
She looked away.
I can't put up with the noise any longer.
You can't handle it.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
I'm sorry, but I didn't catch what you said.
When can you start?
She kindly gave me a ride home.
We caught you.
You guessed right.
It's all gone.
Stop screaming.
You look very pale.
You smell wonderful.
Tom left his sunglasses in his car.
I need water.
I told you you had to go home. Why are you still here?
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
There's no turning back.
I was right behind you.
What brand of dog food do you feed your dog?
Did you wash that?
I had to swerve to avoid hitting the dog.
I thought that was my job.
You're not very good.
Show me the way, please.
Our math teacher drew a circle on the blackboard.
Unless I leave right away, I'll be late for my appointment.
The president called on the people to unite in fighting poverty and disease.
You should give up smoking and drinking.
She listened to music for hours.
It seems that you are not having a good time here.
We're all having lunch.
She told me an interesting story.
I don't remember getting paid for the work.
Tom comforted Mary.
None of these are good enough.
Did you see Tom at school today?
Both of them started laughing.
It's still too early to get up.
Tell her that I love her.
What are the five senses?
I didn't say I liked it.
It wasn't Tom's idea. It was mine.
The child was hiding in the box.
Tom hid behind the shower curtain.
This isn't a party.
I'm not bitter.
I don't know who I'll miss more, you or your brother.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
I am not sure yet if I will go to a university or get a job.
I was born on the twenty-second of June in 1974.
I have three times more books than you do.
They're undamaged.
I wonder if you could get me another beer.
I'm not that lucky.
Long, long ago, there lived an old man in a village.
Are you sure about this?
Tom refused to talk to me.
I'm lucky.
Can you help look after the kids?
I don't like it when you dance with Tom.
She picked out a pink shirt for me to try on.
I'll take care of that.
Could you kill someone?
A lack of sleep affected the singer's performance.
I need to know.
It's not why I'm here.
I was just being friendly.
I really wish I knew how to do that.
Would you like to have a cup of tea?
I shouldn't have gone there by myself.
I sure miss my friends.
That's not acceptable.
I feel completely restored after a week in the country.
I had two copies of the book.
I quite agree with you.
They sat in the shade of that big tree.
More tractors meant fewer horses and mules.
How did it get there?
He traveled with only a dog for company.
I'm not telling you.
I guess you know I've missed you.
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.
What number bus do I take?
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
I'm not ashamed of my father being poor.
I don't think it's possible to do this.
I want a boyfriend.
The car's tires were caked with dried mud.
I think that girl cut her hair to give herself a new look.
Don't try to blame this all on me.
You're right, I think.
Tom took care of the kids yesterday.
Tom was well-known in the community.
They all laughed at his error.
Who is the woman dressed in pink?
They were low enough in cost so many Americans could buy them.
It gives me the shivers.
I want you out of here.
Aren't you thirsty?
Do you want to get some lunch?
Your shelf is full of books.
I have to do it by myself.
Are you falling for me?
Could you knock a little off the price?
What time is dinner?
Tom said it was on his desk.
Frankly, I don't like your idea.
I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
I'm here to help you.
You'd better go.
My father is busy as a bee every day.
Will you give me some time?
Should we be worried?
There is a time for everything.
My friends congratulated me on my success.
Tom doesn't know who Mary wants to give the bottle of wine to.
I hate being alone this time of year.
I had a good teacher.
I'll be inside.
She doesn't admit that she is wrong.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
We're wasting valuable time here.
Do you have a car?
You don't have to wait until the end.
Thank you very much for your letter.
Tom likes them.
I am concerned for her safety.
Why are you so busy today?
I won't keep you too long.
I'll send you the link.
You made my day.
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston.
We can't forget Tom.
I have to talk to you alone.
What does USB stand for?
He sacrificed everything for you.
Where can I buy coffee?
I think the same as they do.
Why did you use up all the money?
Where can I wash my hands?
I know you're not comfortable.
I have failed.
This probably means war.
What's your problem?
You haven't made any mistakes.
Does that mean you bought it?
I'm no match for Tom.
I just want you to listen.
Tom grabbed his coat.
Was it funny?
If you can't beat them, join them.
He is preparing for the test.
No one in his class can run faster than he does.
I have many friends who are native speakers.
It is wise to save money for a rainy day.
We have to solve this problem.
I like a challenge.
We're all in the same situation.
Tom tied the canoe to the top of his car.
The house collapsed a week later.
I think it's good.
Riding a horse is a lot of fun.
I don't think that's the whole story.
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?
Would you care for more coffee?
Nobody can beat me.
I don't make deals with people like you.
What can you make out?
You're such a wimp.
I had no idea you could speak French so well.
How did you get into my house?
They're not dead.
Do you eat rice in your country?
You may use my pen at any time.
I'm not ready to go yet.
You don't have to go.
We can't wait for the weekend.
This book goes on the top shelf.
He has the habit of standing up when he is angry.
I was more than a little shocked by this.
I can ask Tom to help.
He may not be happy.
I haven't told anyone.
Everyone likes you.
Tom was the first person to arrive.
This is a map of the city of Sendai.
They say she's good at cooking.
I felt excited.
I'm hiding.
My grandmother can't see very well.
You look so beautiful.
Who are you waiting for?
All of these letters are addressed to you.
I may actually have to go.
That's very kind of you to say that.
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
Remove your hat.
He received a good education in England.
I've got bills to pay.
You can't build buildings on swampy land.
See you again.
She did not answer all the questions.
There are no problems.
Did you call?
Air is invisible.
You're satisfied.
I just can't wait to go to school.
I figured I'd be safe here.
We're working.
Are you dressed?
I thought I'd find you here.
You're psyched.
I broke up with her.
She approached him with a smile on her face.
I can't tell you what to do.
I'd like to know the reason why.
What you are saying does not make sense.
I gave you fair warning.
I blamed him for the accident.
You have to be here at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
She got him a new hat.
That's why I'm a bachelor.
I'm sorry, I dialed the wrong number.
Is there anything else you can tell me?
It might not even work.
What is the theme of his latest novel?
We can handle that.
I have no idea what that means.
This dog bites.
Let's play cards.
I remember hearing about Tom.
She had a new dress made.
I'll meet you down at the station tomorrow.
Are you wearing that dress for the first time?
I like to finish what I start.
Can you give me a better price?
I'd like to invite you to dinner.
I'll tell you exactly what to say.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
Do you know if she can speak English?
He reads French and German, not to speak of English.
He hates shopping.
Call me.
It's fairly mild for this time of year.
What's his name?
If two people have the same opinion, one of them is redundant.
You'll have to ask somebody else.
I won't stay here alone.
He was disappointed at not being invited.
I think something is wrong.
He'll be groggy for another few hours until the drug wears off.
I think those are the best.
She decided not to go.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't blame you for the accident. It wasn't your fault.
Tell Tom I'm not home.
I want to know all the details.
Go now.
Mary is Tom's mother.
I was hoping I was wrong.
Are you drinking?
He wanted to know more about the trees, too.
Why don't you take your coat off?
I decided on telling her of my love.
It is a great pleasure to be here.
I don't know what it's like yet.
Tom wants children, but Mary doesn't.
I had some trouble finding her house yesterday.
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
I play piano.
Let go of me.
She got angry.
You got what you wanted.
The teacher has given Tom permission to do whatever he wants.
We communicated with each other by gesture.
Can I get a copy of that?
I hid it in my sock drawer.
What will you do?
Tom was sure of it.
Nobody told me you were here.
She seems friendly.
The baby is crawling.
You freaked me out.
Coat the chicken breast with flour.
We're just nervous.
We've got a boat.
Tom has an apartment in Boston.
I don't answer the phone when I'm working.
I worked this morning.
I'm sorry for shouting at you.
You ought not to stay up so late.
It's inspiring.
He was intrigued.
Come in already.
Tom has done his homework.
I look forward to seeing you on my next trip to your city.
Parents should monitor their children's activities.
He kissed me passionately.
I can give you something for your pain.
I have a delivery to make.
Is that your new girlfriend?
They are very kind.
The doctor did a good job on my leg.
Our daughter burned her finger with a match.
I'm not going to try to do that today.
Hurry up.
Tom isn't very athletic.
Tom tried to tell Mary what she needed to do.
I hate the color of these walls.
I'm a high school student.
I found it.
I'll see you at the party.
I can't believe you chickened out.
I was born in Kyoto.
I'm in the bathtub.
Now it's your turn.
We were very busy last week.
We'll all be here for you.
I didn't have the heart to tell him the truth.
It's as cold as ice.
Tom came yesterday.
No one trusts Tom.
Fishing is fun.
What did you watch?
Call me when you can.
I haven't decided.
I have to stop.
You gave me your word that you would look after them.
I'm not crazy. You're the one who's crazy.
Don't make me beg.
I'd like to ask you something.
Let me check my wallet.
My father grows rice.
Tom found the book Mary had given him quite boring.
Tom thinks women in America wear too much perfume.
Who deleted the file?
Can you read that?
Let's try something a little simpler.
He described his own experience.
We solved that problem in a week.
I can't be something I'm not.
Banks charge higher interest on loans to risky customers.
Everyone looks confused.
You remind me of your mother.
What time does the next train leave for Tokyo?

I tried thinking about why it was that I didn't trust him.
That plan is unacceptable.
I just don't think I can do it.
He abandoned his family and moved to Tahiti.
I don't care how much you want it. I'm not going to give it to you.
Tom was my first real boyfriend.
It's snowing again.
It'll be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Get off at the next stop and take a bus headed to the airport.
I just wanted clarification.
The lawyer seems to think it'll be an open and shut case.
The man finally confessed.
Measure twice, cut once.
I don't want to be alone with Tom.
We have plenty of wine.
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars.
What part of Canada are you from?
I don't think I can do anything.
Have you finished your meal?
I understand how hard this is.
You're very flexible.
The thermometer says it's thirty degrees in here.
Don't ever do that again.
He wanted to test his limits.
You can't quit now.
I am thinking about buying a new parasol.
Keep it secret, please.
You're a jolly good feller.
"A rolling stone gathers no moss" is a proverb.
I can sing it in English.
He made her a bookshelf.
Are you coming in or not?
I had no choice but to come.
Call if you need anything.
We need your assistance.
Don't you want to come inside?
I believe in my teammates.
I don't believe Tom is a racist.
What is it you want me to do?
There was no response.
Please wake me at six.
Police are urging people not to pick up hitchhikers as they search for two prisoners on the run after escaping from jail.
It's unusual for you to do something like that.
I need political asylum.
Tom isn't cooperative.
The mere sight of a dog frightens him.
They live on the 12th floor of this condo.
How bad is the damage?
How did you kill the guards?
Are you lonely?
It's true that he saw a monster.
This is a good book for children to read.
Why do you ask?
Tom didn't know why Mary needed to borrow thirty dollars.
Take hold of the rope.
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
Please take care of yourself.
I knew that already.
We are sorry to say that we can not give you that information.
This is not going to end well.
Do you want me to leave the light on?
I want you to watch this video.
At last, it began to rain.
A white dove is on the roof.
I'm kind of busy tonight.
This chair is Tom's.
I go up to the rooftop when I want to see the blue sky.
She always keeps her word.
He saved her at the cost of his own life.
Well done!
No one is amused.
I've been sent to relieve you.
I'll take my dog out for a walk.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
The escaped prisoners are still on the run.
How long were you gone?
Let's get back to work.
Are you dyslexic?
She asked me to pass her the salt.
I'm not the problem.
This book is old.
The situation changed the following year.
My legs are hurting.
I said it was OK for him to go.
I thought it over and decided not to go.
I'm not sad.
Can you tell what's wrong with it?
Your answer is wrong.
Tom is obese, isn't he?
Could you show me that necktie?
What time is dinner served?
You're the tallest person here.
Next time, I'll do it myself.
We considered it.
Can you wait a minute?
Let go of my arm!
His wife goes with him wherever he goes.
Mary isn't Tom's wife.
That's my fault.
I got scammed.
Bring me today's paper, please.
I will advise you on the matter.
She saw a young man at the entrance.
His anger towards me has not softened.
If Tom had had something to throw, he'd have thrown it.
He comes home almost every weekend.
We competed with each other for the prize.
He is too drunk to drive home.
I was home all day yesterday.
Choose either of the two T-shirts.
Where is the post office?
You should probably speak a little bit slower.
What would you do if you had a billion dollars?
Mathematics is not just the memorization of formulas.
Our request was approved.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
They weren't invited.
I don't know why you didn't tell the truth.
I want one!
He knows every inch of this area.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
You had a week to finish this.
What other choice do we have?
I would like to travel alone.
Close the door after you when you leave the room.
I'll take it all.
I don't like the taste of tomatoes.
I think it won't rain this afternoon.
He was disappointed.
I'm working.
I eagerly await your decision.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
Why not let Tom try?
We all have our orders.
I will gladly help you.
You're very astute.
Balls are round.
You've done it!
I had my suitcase carried up to my room.
He'll be late for the meeting.
You may go there.
She testified that she saw the man.
They were prohibited from leaving the hotel.
I could not have done otherwise.
I have a lot of patients.
I like being with you.
Because of the pills I took, the pain went away.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
You're turning red.
The manufacturer guaranteed the new machine for 5 years.
The king would not even read the message.
You're not fit.
I knew it was just a misunderstanding.
Who's the composer of this symphony?
Of course I will go.
Tom says you've never been to Boston.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
What else do you need?
Thank you for the other day.
Tom told me that he couldn't really trust Microsoft.
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
She plays Bach.
Get in the car and lock the doors.
I can't believe I'm stuck here in this room with you.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
A slight cold prevented me from going to Ibusuki with my family.
I have no reason to lie to you.
I just don't want to be left alone.
I want to be with you more than anything.
Well, Tom, shouldn't we tell Mary?
I work for an oil company.
You seemed to like that.
I'm forgetful.
I like it so much.
Long story short, I was fired.
You will miss Japanese food in the United States.
I got this bicycle for nothing.
"Will you have another slice of pie?" "Yes, please."
I didn't know you then.
Is he done using the telephone?
Medical marijuana is legal in this state.
I hope you've got some proof to back up your allegations.
He receives a high salary.
He risked his life to save her.
I can't handle this without your help.
I haven't been back here since that unfortunate incident.
I'm smarter than you.
He is angry with you.
I didn't sleep well.
I was nearly hit by a car.
If for some reason a man stopped thinking, that man would no longer be a man.
Did I embarrass you?
There will be an energy crisis in the near future.
They entertained us at dinner last night.
Grab as much as you need.
Do you need much money?
I just stayed quiet.
What time does your plane depart?
Had you been drinking?
I'd like to run a big stock farm.
The king imposed heavy taxes on the people.
I'm giving you an opportunity.
Was Tom telling the truth?
She looks young, but as a matter of fact she is older than you are.
He claimed to be an expert in finance.
Tom is Mary's biological father.
Tom always gets up at six-thirty.
I refused to eat until my parents came home.
This is what'll happen.
Could you possibly translate this for me?
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
Those are Tom's cats.
Do you think that'll work?
What's your name?
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I want to see your boss.
What do you want the message to be?
He was fascinated with her beauty.
She suggested that I take him to the zoo.
I'm satisfied.
You should've gotten up earlier.
She was very proud of her father.
We need to think together about the future of Europe.
He's a good liar.
The table was covered with paper.
I led that mission.
You may invite anyone you like.
I'm beginning to feel a little sleepy.
Take care not to catch a cold.
A lot of people are waiting to see what is going to happen.
Tom can be extremely dangerous.
He keeps on asking me for money.
We felt sympathy for her.
He took charge of the family business after his father died.
The towel was quite useless.
Don't misunderstand my words.
I appreciate your concern.
The product is guaranteed to be free from defects.
You should have accepted his advice.
Why did Tom lie?
This beef is good.
Fold up the map.
Where am I?
People have short memories.
The instant he opened the door, he smelt something burning.
Did Tom forget to pay?
He's the most likely to succeed.
He has to have his blood pressure taken every day.
Tom accepted the job.
He fell to the floor.
How fast can you do it?
Tom doesn't look like a rebel.
Do you have more than one copy of this key?
I was asked to wait here.
Who will write the report?
Turn your papers in.
There's plenty of water.
Commit these words to memory.
Can you remember the first time we met each other?
You're not the only neurosurgeon here.
Where's your shirt?
You should have kept your mouth shut.
The boy made a paper plane.
I'm going to get on the next bus.
Did I miss the turn?
There are few men who don't know that.
Tom was extremely impolite.
The trees are beginning to bud.
He got the first prize.
After the rain, there were puddles on the street.
I've decided to buy the blue car instead of the red one.
He turned to his friend for help.
I should've warned you.
Tom is not going to be happy about this.
Everybody needs one.
He's not good at remembering names.
I only need one thing.
It's pretty hot.
I don't care what you think.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Hasn't he looked at himself in a mirror?
It's so easy when you know the rules.
Do it right now.
Can you handle it?
His brother was lost in the town.
It was preventable.
Is your mother at home?
I hid behind a tree.
Tom knows you're here.
You should be careful.
He wiped his nose on his sleeve.
History is merely repeating itself.
What's kept you?
I'm not sure what you were thinking.
You're invited.
I still have some homework to do.
I'm glad you see it that way.
I really don't have much choice, do I?
You sound tired.
She's waiting for you at home.
Nobody knows when the earthquake will occur.
Is everybody here?
My father is proud of being tall and handsome.
That was some pretty good advice.
No one would talk about it.
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
He searched all day for the letter.
You missed the meeting.
We've had a lot of complaints about how you treat your classmates.
Where is it hidden?
How about a drink?
That's not important right now.
I'd like to have a cat.
This is a dangerous mission.
If you stand on this stool, you can reach the top of the closet.
It is their last movie.
Do you want another one of these?
Go ahead, try it now.
Don't make a sound.
I would never let you down.
Tom is the defending champion.
What are you trying to do?
It didn't end well.
That's what I'm asking you to do.
This mission entails huge risks.
I don't want you to do that, Tom.
She can't have said so.
He couldn't pass the examination.
It was chilly that day.
Dancing is not a crime.
It's on my desk.
That's my final offer.
You've been selected.
Have you been crying all night? Your eyes are all puffy.
He is an environmentalist.
There's a body in the trunk of the car.
He is not a singer, but an actor.
What language do they speak in Switzerland?
He meant no harm.
Have you ever thought about quitting your job?
Don't talk to the driver.
Is this your first trip abroad?
This town hasn't changed much in the last ten years.
It'll take some time to finish unloading the truck.
He warned me of the danger.
I'm still shopping around.
It's time for you to tell me the whole truth.
Can't you do anything to stop them?
Tom refused to take part in the game.
I think we're going to be fine.
I can't stop myself.
I live right around the corner.
I think that's a good sign.
Tom put on a coat.
Do you think that's significant?
He proved to be a spy.
The situation is growing serious.
How do you do that?
They caught him playing a trick on his sister.
Who should we believe?
We're not supposed to do that.
She talks to her sister on the phone for hours at a time.
He fell in love with the girl at first sight.
You're fussy.
If I were you, I would paint it blue.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
I'm wearing a sweater because I feel cold.
How can you eat at a time like this?
She has no figure.
Would you step aside?
You don't have to tell me this.
He likes to cook for his family.
I'd rather stay at home than go out.
You didn't tell me everything.
Clerks with sticky fingers won't keep their jobs for long.
She looked lonely.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
He seems to be sick.
Pack your gear.
I hate this car.
I want to play, too.
It's fine today.
Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today.
What kind of part-time job do you have?
Darkness is the absence of light.
I saw you outside.
Tom was awesome.
Have you heard from her?
There's no need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
I want a new dress.
Tom backed out of the room.
They were born in Thailand.
Drivers should be aware of the traffic rules.
I don't know who you're talking about.
I always carry a bottle of mineral water with me.
The baby in the cradle is very pretty.
Do you really want to eat that?
This church is huge.
I don't like it when you swear.
I really should go.
How lucky you are!
My French teacher is the same age as me.
If Tom needs help, we can give it to him.
Tom is one of the few people I can trust.
You're finished already.
How many did you get?
You have friends who can help you, don't you?
I'll be with you in five minutes.
Where did Tom go yesterday?
Those houses are 500 years old.
We've had a lot of rain this year.
Is life here hard?
Why don't you start by telling us how you feel?
I knew what you meant.
The meeting was all but over.
She bought a toy for the kid.
You said it was important.
That may not be so easy.
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
Do you like music?
I hope you find it interesting.
Tom wasn't thinking straight.
I wish I had a room of my own.
You seem a little nervous.
I was going to take a nap.
I think Tom is still sleeping.
I can't be seen with you.
He is the president of the company in fact.
That's all we can ask.
Come join us.
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
There aren't any problems.
She is kissing him.
I'd like to reserve a table for three.
Why are you worried?
That was without doubt a magical moment.
I told you it was dangerous.
Will you go to the dance with me?
My boss is a slave driver.
She's asking how that's possible.
Don't you think Tom will be able to do that?
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
Are you ready to work?
I never mentioned it again.
I can't go back without you.
Tom couldn't believe what had happened.
When I visited their apartment, the couple was right in the middle of an argument.
There are many possible explanations.
It was much more difficult than we initially thought.
Books are made out of paper.
I hope you know that the last thing I want to do is go there without your permission.
I did not order this.
I might be a few minutes late.
Is everything in position?
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
She prodded him to work harder.
He's a cardiologist.
She made the same mistake again.
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it.
She's busy now and can't talk with you.
Do you know anyone who was on that ship that sunk?
I'm no expert.
I haven't talked to you in a while.
She speaks Spanish well.
Throw another log on the fire, will you?
How do you think you'd look wearing that dress?
I'm glad Tom was able to see you while you were in Boston.
This is theirs.
I wonder why Tom sang that song, even though Mary asked him not to.
A beautiful salesgirl waited on me in the shop.
Keep an eye on the boys. They're mischievous.
It may sound strange, but what he said is true.
Hi! How are you?
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants to eat for dinner.
What's it doing out here?
I think that's enough.
If you're not happy, quit.
If you don't leave now, you'll be late.
He plays poker with them.
She is very afraid of the dark.
What is it you want most?
Tom told me he was really busy.
Paper burns easily.
I'm not marrying you.
I'm not exactly surprised.
I want a new kitchen.
That isn't a cat.
Tom can't swim as well as Mary can.
There's not much to say.
When did you go to work?
What did he do during the holidays?
Everybody was silent.
We cannot offer a further price reduction under the current circumstances.
Things got out of hand.
Is there a telephone nearby?
Why don't you grow up?
Tom heard everything they said.
This room is air-conditioned.
I thought you were serious.
He's married.
You know how it is.
She tried to conceal her grief at the party.
He's an outlaw.
Have you found your contact lenses?
Are you thirsty?
I think Tom is a really nice kid.
I can't find the right words.
It started raining just as I was leaving home.
Is there hot water?
It's a waste of resources.
We will make it public.
Tom wants me to coach him.
It's possible that Tom lied to you.
I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it.
I brought a book.
It's a piece of cake.
Please make a right turn.
Check out what I've been up to.
We'll talk about it later.
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
He traveled throughout the country.
She will be in New York for two weeks.
He came all the way to talk over a problem with me.
That's a promise.
I bought an umbrella.
Tom and Mary want to learn French.
Tom doesn't have any money on him.
We all work too hard.
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
Isn't there something you want to say to Tom?
Can you help me paint my house?
I think it's about time we got started.
I know his address.
She and I are in the same class.
I really don't want to go back to jail.
I think you need to see him.
He caught a big fish.
How big is your yard?
I thought I heard a voice.
How do you know where to go?
I was heartbroken.
Don't worry about that.
I had a crush on you when we were in high school.
Give me a chance.
Tom is still young.
I didn't do anything illegal.
I think I've forgotten something.
It was unbelievable.
Please give me one of these.
Where is the elevator?
You have not seen it.
It is said that his father died in a foreign country.
It all happened kind of fast.
I'll talk.
It's never too late to start.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
He picked up a butterfly between his thumb and forefinger.
I know your time is valuable, but could I ask you just one question?
He was working at the office yesterday evening.
Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Why don't you talk to me about it?
I don't believe any of it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
I don't like your friends.
They are my friends.
That boy is really shy.
That looks good.
I'm from America.
I've got to go to another dreary meeting tomorrow.
We're well on our way to making that happen.
I feel sorry for her.
I've made this mistake before.
I'm a detective.
Where's my driver?
Words cannot convey my feelings.
I am ashamed of having been rude to her.
I have as many books as he does.
The door opened suddenly.
Are you working?
At last, the baby fell asleep.
Is there no other way?
I'm a little confused.
Get rid of the gun.
I thought you should see this contract.
I'm studying French because I need it for my job.
I don't know how you can tolerate doing this over and over again.
I never read the book.
Is this Tom's umbrella?
Have you met any Canadians here in Boston?
I thought I recognized you.
Her husband also wanted custody of the children.
Tom has come to see you.
He owns many valuable paintings.
Tom doesn't understand French at all.
I wanted to talk to them face to face.
The book was published posthumously.
I'm not saying that you're not beautiful.
I am taking my son to the zoo this afternoon.
Why are you ignoring me?
After days of warm weather, it became cold.
He's not in the mood.
I think it's time for me to call it quits.
Tom is always crying.
I know Tom was hesitant to do that.
It's easy to remember.
What's the meaning of that?
He is reading a book.
I've waited two whole hours. I can't wait any longer.
This is not my first time riding a bicycle.
The door must not be left open.
Are you satisfied with my explanation?
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
His old cat is still alive.
Let's get the others.
I'm sure I turned off the gas.
She does not like him.
We've no choice.
He told me an interesting story.
Wait right here.
I find that fascinating.
Don't forget that she's a woman.
I'm glad to see you again.
You should never have done that.
Promise me you won't to do anything stupid.
The medicine worked marvels.
Do you know the answer?
I'm the one who brought the subject up.
She was watching TV when I came home.
This course teaches basic skills in First Aid.
She said nothing that would make him angry.
It doesn't look like anybody's home.
Where have you been all week?
I've never dated anyone taller than me.
Yesterday I hit on a good idea.
I won't betray your trust.
You don't seem too sure.
This one's a little harder.
I hate to see you so miserable.
You'll never leave this town.
This will not be tolerated.
Why don't you take the day off?
He found me a nice tie.
I never asked for it.
We need to go shopping.
Tom loved it.
Will she forgive him for forgetting her birthday?
My right shoulder hurts.
We swam in the sea.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here is your bag.
I oppose it.
Whether we win or lose, I won't have any hard feelings.
We had to put off the meeting.
He knows a lot about butterflies.
Why are you visiting us?
What did you buy for me?
I go jogging.
I was only trying to help.
What's all the hurry?
Is that what Tom told you?
You give up too easily.
I just came from there.
She couldn't convince him to accept a personal check.
The situation became chaotic.
You should never cut corners on safety.
I never murdered anybody.
I forgot my shopping list at home.
That hat looks good on you.
I can't get anyone to assist me.
I sent you an email.
A lot of books are published every year.
Who's the oldest person you know?
Can you tell me about it?
What would you do if you saw a man from another planet?
I'd like to do that now.
She betrayed you.
Tom said that he thought that pair of shoes were too expensive.
Have you ever eaten a banana pie?
I'm not impressed.
Have you considered therapy?
She disguised herself as him.
We're the problem.
Don't you just hate technology?
Be kind to old people.
Don't try to pull a fast one on me!
I can't believe Tom knows where Mary lives.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
That gave me a rough idea.
I had to cancel that order because we didn't have enough money to pay for it.
Where's the money I gave you?
Tom looked at his reflection in the mirror.
I bought this book at Maruzen Bookstore.
There wasn't much else we could do.
Could you please fix this?
What do you know about him?
Adjust your tie.
I want to make sure there is enough.
In his free time, he likes to be on the Internet.
Read over your paper before you hand it in.
We talked about various topics.
She is quick at everything.
My father drives very well.
Your hat's on backwards.
Hey, don't forget this.
Several politicians exerted strong pressure on the committee.
That's not how I want to be remembered.
If they'd taken their doctors' advice, they might not have died.
Are you sincere?
She raised her hands.
Stop being so nice to me.
My dream is to go to Japan.
I wanted to be a piano teacher.
I leave in the morning.
I'm sure that's what Tom would've wanted.
There's no harm in trying.
Be reasonable.
Are you all ready?
You may use my dictionary.
However hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can.
Please explain how to take the medicine.
He bought her a sweater.
Hey, open the door.
I have no clue.
Yokohama is a beautiful port town.
His wife is in the hospital because she was injured in a car crash.
Take care of your health.
He kept on crying.
Keep your head low.
Ring the bell when you want me.
The fire that broke out last night was judged to be caused by arson.
I didn't break it.
This invention will make you very rich.
Why do you like horses?
Let me know what you find out.
Are you spending enough time with your kids?
He swore never to trust her again.
Whatever you do, don't drop your new phone.
That's one of them.
What would you say if you were in my place?
When I last saw him, he was wearing a blue shirt and white slacks.
He ordered me to sweep the room.
But his name is slightly familiar to me.
A dog has a sharp sense of smell.
Why do you hate me?
I can't condone what you did.
They're bad.
Tom seemed very impressed.
I've got all the friends I need.
Tell me which one to choose.
I won't be back for a while.
Classes begin at 8 o'clock.
Tom will go, too, won't he?
We're not going to make it.
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
We hope this will be to your satisfaction.
I need to ask you a few more questions.
I don't have enough money to buy a new bicycle.
That is what they study English for.
Why didn't you tell me?
I want to trust you.
You're the oldest.
I don't know what this is about.
You have to fight.
My bike was stolen last night.
We have a big day tomorrow.
He said, "It's nine o'clock."
May I speak to you a minute?
A man's life has its ups and downs.
All graduates are invited.
They're twins.
You're spending too much time on the computer.
Let's play by ourselves.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
I don't snore.
I know you want to make me happy.
You and I aren't like that.
Tom is a psychologist.
What would you do in my place?
How did you get interested in art?
You know what they can do, don't you?
I can help you.
We were very sorry we couldn't help them.
He died the next day.
I asked my mother what to bring there.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
Neither of those boys can speak French.
You're not very good.
It happens a lot.
This is love.
That's a nice coat.
Can they see me?
It isn't just for show.
Tom decided to go home early.
What time did you go to bed last night?
My mother is sick in bed.
Tom is supposed to do that without any help.
My uncle lived in Washington, D. C. for two years.
Dogs are loyal animals.
I want to teach you something.
I have good news for you.
Let me see it.
You must not touch the paintings.
Sign this.
It is what everybody says.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
It is necessary that you see a doctor.
I love this store.
I have a bruise.
Do you have any more of those?
Did you finish the job?
I wonder if Tom is trying to kill me.
I miss my cat.
We made friends with them.
He completely failed to understand why she got angry.
You're a bodybuilder, aren't you?
I am fond of music.
She was in time for the bus.
They look similar in some ways.
How did you do that?
I don't see any problem.
They looked at the photo taken of me when I was a boy and laughed.
What makes you so sure that this won't happen again?
I have a couple questions.
How did you come by this painting?
Nice of you to drop by.
I misspelled the word.
You're very funny.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
He is likely to be late for school.
Did you make this?
I'm not buying it.
We're a family.
She accompanied her friend to the concert.
I'll find friends wherever I go.
Everybody's life is complicated.
It has been just a week since I arrived in New York.
Tom would never leave Mary.
Can I borrow cash with this card?
I wish that she would stop smoking.
I notice the sale prices are written in red ink.
The young man lives in an old house.
Finally, I have my own car.
He never saw his sister again.
I've never felt like this before.
Keep singing.
He happened to catch sight of a rare butterfly.
I want to buy them all.
I invited him over to my place.
I'd like to earn my keep while I'm staying with you.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I'd been on my own all week and was starving for conversation.
Tom didn't want his friends to see him cry.
He could not find what I had hidden.
What are your instincts telling you?
I slept with my clothes on.
You're a nervous wreck.
I'll come back for you.
This is how I made it.
It seems that I have lost my keys.
He asked a question about it.
Who are you working for now?
She fainted.
Tom prefers blondes.
I'm unenthusiastic.
I'm not tired at all.
A big bomb fell, and a great many people lost their lives.
The snow prevented the airplane from taking off.
Would you like to see your room?
I hate to argue with you.
I was momentarily blinded.
I don't think you really want to know.
I can hear someone talking in the next room.
He rejected our offer.
He could not go to college.
He can swim fast.
I will come on Wednesday evening unless I hear from you to the contrary.
This pen is very easy to write with.
I know he's the one who did it.
I really appreciated your help yesterday afternoon.
This offer is available for five days.
You have to memorize this sentence.
If you can't come, you should let me know ahead of time.
He betrayed you.
I'm a social worker.
There were no more than two books on the desk.
Tom didn't like school.
I'll show you later.
They want to know what's happening.
Things are not like they used to be.
I must leave early tomorrow.
That's why he got angry.
I'm just going to run down to the bank.
Let's do this properly.
I usually wake up at six.
Everything has a purpose.
I don't want to think about what could have happened.
Some people are working in the fields.
I want you back.
She advised him not to go.
I will sue you.
Do you want to tell the jury what happened?
She is two years older than you.
They're not following.
They set out for New York.
You said you were going to handle it.
Maybe Tom was sick.
I was discouraged.
Do you think it'll stay that way?
He asked me if I was happy.
Take anything you want.
I loved high school.
Do you really mean that?
Will she come?
Don't tell me to calm down.
Read what's on the label.
There's one problem with this.
The top of the mountain is covered in snow.
My sister usually walks to school.
I'm comfortable.
That's as good a place as any.
She was fond of talking about herself.
Would you like me to do that for you?
I tried to do that, but I couldn't.
I used to listen to English programs.
You should've never come here.
Do it now.
I've been trying to put a little money in the bank every month.
You weren't serious, were you?
She had nothing to say about it.
You'll feel at home.
Didn't you read the book?
When will it begin?
Wow! You've lost a lot of weight.
I hate this car.
I'm aware of the facts.
His cottage is on the coast.
He is a man who loves ceremonies.
I had a lot of help.
He is far from happy.
This is a big project.
Fast forward to the part where they're kissing.
Are you going to be home for Christmas?
I thought your house was downtown.
Was the baby crying then?
What a jerk!
This report is badly written and is full of mistakes.
He did nothing but watch TV all day.
The soldiers were guarding the bridge.
He has a car that I gave him.
The workers took pride in their work.
Our apartment is starting to look pretty cool.
I don't think it'll rain this afternoon.
Grab as much as you need.
I can give it a try.
My mother cooks for me.
I need to handle this alone.
I will accompany you.
There've been times when that's happened.
Tom scratched his name off the list.
I'll manage it.
I'd take it if I were you.
I study French for three hours every day.
Am I under suspicion here?
I'm accustomed to sleeping in a room without air conditioning.
I want to be here with you.
I don't really want to learn French.
I really liked what you cooked for me.
I can see it in your eyes.
You don't look happy.
There is a lot of crime in big cities.
The statue of Hachiko, the faithful dog, stands in front of Shibuya Station.
The home team won.
They told me it was your fault.
I did see something.
I hate that you have to leave.
Do you want to take that?
I'm not doing that.
Last Sunday, Mary and I went to the library together.
I'm not expecting anyone.
What does this device do?
They want to increase food production by growing new kinds of rice.
That's all that matters now.
Do you like playing volleyball?
He is always at home on Mondays.
Tom pretended to be Canadian.
I want mine.
I hope you're happy, too.
What does he expect?
Frankly speaking, I don't like your idea.
They loved Tom.
That's what you don't understand.
They found it.
The medicine had no effect.
Why does Tom drink so much?
I prefer to eat alone.
He has a deep affection for his son.
You know where I'm going.
What does that gentleman do for a living?
He's about the same age as you are.
They won't last that long.
You shouldn't eat any fish that come from this river.
A molecule of water is made up of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.
Do you have any idea who she is?
We must think about these plans in terms of what they would cost.
She blamed her failure on bad luck.
Where is the railroad station?
Did you have any luck?
Don't deceive him.
The noise doesn't bother us.
Sydney is far from here.
How about a beer?
The body and the mind of man are so closely bound together that whatever affects one affects the other.
You should listen to me.
How do you know they're looking for us?
You don't have to hurry.
Tom was afraid that Mary might change her mind.
I don't have a lot of time.
I don't know when he got back from France.
We came by to wish you luck.
Boston is a large city.
She was only 18 when she graduated from university.
I didn't even see you once last year.
Let me get that for you.
Why is life so difficult?
I didn't want to wait for anything.
I'll be six feet under by then.
What do you think happens then?
It was fine all day.
She moved out of her parents' house.
I think you need to see him.
I don't know what the truth is.
When we arrived, the lecture had already begun.
Are you referring to me?
I don't need it now.
That's a complex question.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Let me think it over, and I'll let you know later.
I'm sure things will work out.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
I just did what anybody would've done.
That program is still far from perfect.
Have you read that book?
We have to escape.
She realized that she had better tell the truth.
I want to do my job the best I can.
Are you seriously thinking about getting involved?
He's really good looking.
How can I change your mind?
Who invited you here?
She showed me which dress to wear.
Do you trust me?
I figured I had enough money.
There are many words that I don't understand.
She is as poor as ever.
Cool off!
We had a short vacation in February.
There is an urgent need for money.
Australia is abundant in minerals.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
He can't go without wine for even a day.
That toy is made of wood.
That's quite meaningless.
It's never too late to make amends for harm done.
Are you afraid of it?
It's not just about the money.
You'd be perfect for that.
My aunt treats me as if I were a child.
He's good at this sort of thing.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
You learn something new every day.
She advised him to stop working so much.
We understand you perfectly.
He doesn't drink anymore.
I don't really want you mad at me.
Who will you go with?
My brother and I were very close.
I'm not really asleep, just dozing.
Put on your pajamas and go to bed.
I'd be glad to tell Tom how to do that.
What do you grow on your farm?
Her husband wants to have his own way in everything.
Won't you have some tea?
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
I thought everyone knew.
Did you write this fairy tale by yourself?
Write to Tom.
Did you pay somebody to write this for you?
It's a typo. Sorry.
I thought I was cool.
Walk slowly.
It doesn't make any sense.
Do you get it?
My mother is constantly forgetting people's names.
Let's compromise.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I saw Tom entering that restaurant.
Do you have anything hot to drink?
I didn't have time to think. I had to make a judgment call.
The meeting's about to start.
Can I go out to play?
This book is both interesting and instructive.
That day shall come.
I need a volunteer.
She was in a silk dress.
He's your father.
Let us agree to disagree.
I got tickets yesterday.
Most of them just don't care.
You aren't going to cry, are you?
I almost got a perfect score.
The children are creating a painting.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
They set out on a picnic.
They're working.
I can't imagine life on another planet.
I knew who he was.
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
My father has a personality disorder.
I love your city.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
It's incredible, isn't it?
We all understand.
It was fun while it lasted.
I lied to you the other night.
I just don't want to discuss it right now.
Are you with us, Tom?
Children often cry just because they want some attention.
You're silly.
I see you are ready.
I'll meet you outside.
What were you and Tom talking about?
I took a taxi because the bus was late.
It was white.
I found a way out.
Mary is Tom's cousin.
I will do it by all means.
Beauty is only skin deep.
I don't even know you.
He has a sharp tongue.
They won't listen to you.
She is aggressive.
We went to the café that I told you about.
You're off the hook.
His grandmother can't walk, can she?
We'll allow a 5 percent discount off list prices.
Let's work on one project at a time.
Do you need to drink wine?
He didn't run fast enough to catch the train.
He looks like a monkey.
The battery needs to be recharged.
You may use his library.
Even the greatest scholar can't solve that.
I know Tom is tough.
How could it have happened?
Are you in favor of the new law?
You can sit down if you want.
I couldn't breathe.
Why would you want to be a teacher?
I just want to make it home in one piece.
You've got a pretty good memory.
I ran away from home when I was thirteen.
She wants to kill me.
That would appear to be correct.
The boy stayed quiet.
How's your project coming along?
He is often absent from school.
I don't like that sentence.
Throw another log on the fire, will you?
Tom is Mary's hero.
I'm in love with a wonderful girl.
Prices have reached a 13-year high.
She's well known as a singer.
I considered changing my job.
You can't handle it.
She never stops complaining.
I'm expecting a call.
He took off his coat and put it on again.
The detective I hired called to tell me he has a promising lead.
Her hair is long.
He came back soon.
This is unusual.
Tom followed me to the garage.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
They're just students.
We should place much value on the environment.
Keep focused on your goals.
Which one of those is yours?
I'm desperate.
My life is almost over.
To loosen a screw, turn it to the left.
If you want that, you can have it.
I don't know what to do now.
Who hates you?
Living in the town is quite different from living in the country.
The country is abundant in natural resources.
Tom often plays tennis with Mary after school.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm sorry but I can't attend the meeting in person.
Enjoy yourself for a change.
I had to do it by myself.
Be polite to everyone.
I left a note on your door this morning.
Tell me you're kidding.
They had been thinking about it for some time.
Those were the best years of my life.
The last examination was very difficult.
We need a password to use this computer.
She is her friend.
You don't seem very pleased.
Please sing.
I asked Tom to keep an open mind.
I'd like some time alone, please.
He's waiting for you at home.
I'm smarter than you.
I have a job to do.
I respect your talent.
I have errands to run.
We can rely on his judgement.
I wonder how much time we've wasted so far.
I don't have time for a walk.
"Who will be coming to the party?" "A few friends and four or five colleagues."
We didn't look very long.
It is abnormal to have the heart on the right side.
What exactly are they doing in there?
Most women enjoy shopping.
She sued him.
Why are you worrying about something that doesn't matter so much?
She didn't intend to let him drive.
I know Tom is miserable.
We learned about the importance of eating a healthy lunch.
I just don't get it.
I'll be back in just a second.
Stop dating losers!
He looks confused.
She stopped our fighting.
You don't have to be so rude.
I ran out of gas.
No more can be said.
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
She put sheets on her bed.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
There is a problem.
There's no sign of infection.
Why not apply for that job?
Sit down and rest for a while.
It is very cold here all the year round.
She showed me her new car.
I think Tom is old.
That's what I wanted.
I have lived here for a long time.
I can't believe you think I'm pushy.
Who's the highest bidder?
Please don't let this happen again.
Tell me what really happened.
Look up the number in the telephone book.
The number of fish in the ocean is steadily declining.
This coat is warm.
How many times a week do you spend time doing fun stuff with your children?
There are signs of growing tensions between the two countries.
He is very angry.
I was going to call him, but thought better of it.
You can't smoke in here.
You have to go.
I know who lives in that house.
Please give my regards to your parents.
All men must die.
Would you like to be rich?
I met an old friend of mine.
Pass me the salt and pepper, please.
Weddings are expensive.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm disappointed.
The more unique each person is, the more he contributes to the wisdom of others.
I can't wait to hear it.
The company issued a press release.
Tom went skiing alone.
My mother finally approved of our plan.
I sure do hope so.
Tom seems to be a nice fellow.
I got hot.
I just wanted to let you know.
They enjoyed themselves.
I have lost my watch.
I heard screaming.
I panicked.
What was it that he was looking for?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm starved.
Tom pulled the rope.
I thought you'd be proud of me.
This is bad.
You don't have to get up so early.
Please see to it that the dog doesn't go out.
It was a dangerous journey.
I accept your terms.
She is certainly above forty.
What I need is a friend.
When were you born?
He's watching me.
There are many more people than I expected.
How many players are there?
What if Tom doesn't like me?
His words surprised me.
I noticed that he had stopped.
I think that's fantastic.
Aren't you afraid of anything?
I sell clothing online.
The teacher told them to stop fighting.
There is no one there.
Don't raise my hopes like that.
Did I say something funny?
I want to ask you something.
Do you need a deposit?
I wanted to show it to you.
My teacher drove me home.
Tom took more than one picture, didn't he?
If one has the right to live, then one should also have the right to die. If not, then living is not a right, but an obligation.
He owes his success to good luck.
Be merciful.
Do you want me to call the police?
That boy has black hair.
How do they want to receive their money?
Tom is watching golf.
Back off.
This is priceless.
Be proud of yourself.
Where is the exit?
Before going to work in Paris, I must brush up on my French.
You're new around here, aren't you?
I don't feel well.
Tom stepped off the train.
You must stop him.
I always knew you'd be back.
The door opened slowly.
He went back to the store.
He isn't married.
Don't get all high and mighty.
It looks like it's just the two of us.
You aren't wrong.
I can't talk right now. I need to go.
He was angry because of what she said.
What is your decision?
I love to party.
This is my fate.
He has a very good voice.
Do your homework right away.
Are you seriously thinking about buying that old car?
There used to be an art museum in this neighborhood.
How did you reply?
He is stronger than I am.
This computer doesn't work.
Let's sit on the grass.
You're finicky.
Don't bother to answer this letter.
I have many model cars.
I did what I could.
It's instinct.
How do you remember that?
Can you play the organ?
Are you allergic to any medicines?
Would you like to go out for a drink after work?
This island belonged to France in the 19th century.
Is that what Tom told you?
I am responsible for the mistake.
I feel like I know you.
I know the answer.
Do you feel like having a drink?
There isn't any solution.
Our fence is made of iron.
Try not to panic.
You're a wonderful friend.
The world is a crazy place.
He works in a call center.
How did you know we were here?
Only one person survived the accident.
I'm fully aware of that.
Do you sell any guidebooks written in French?
You just wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to say about that.
I heard Tom scream.
I would rather not go shopping alone.
Are you sure we have enough beer?
I grew up around here.
Please knock before entering.
What is it you want to tell us?
This house is registered in my name.
I never wanted to hurt you.
This school was founded in 1970.
We went skiing in Canada.
I like the smell of bread just out of the oven.
You should take my advice.
Let me know where you're staying.
You shouldn't break promises.
Would you care for some more cake?
I lost my inspiration.
It's Monday.
I won't do that.
Tom didn't know their names.
Your dress is unsuitable for the occasion.
Please turn off the light so that I can sleep.
They're spies.
We made sure of it.
Japanese should not forget that America is a multiracial nation.
I've never seen Tom behave this way before.
I prepared two translations of the text.
We worry about your future.
Anything you say may be used against you.
It was the coldest inaugural day in the nation's history.
A Japanese would never do such a thing.
I've never felt this way about anyone before.
This book is so difficult, I can't read it.
Before he died, he was almost blind.
He pushed me gently.
My friends are all married.
Tom didn't come to school today because he had to go to a funeral.
I'm not very musically inclined.
I want to cut down on the time it takes to process records.
Those present at the meeting were surprised at the news.
I was wondering the same thing.
Your answer to the question turned out to be wrong.
We adopted an alternative method.
He's sketching an apple.
I thought you were kidding.
What will the weather be like?
Do you still have feelings for him?
Tom was real happy.
Last night there was a fire near here, and I couldn't sleep.
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
I thought you were older than me.
The accounts have been audited.
Would you like to know how I did that?
You're embarrassing yourself.
I don't know how long we've got.
They're crazy.
Another thing that is required is a dictionary.
What would I do without you?
There's nothing to be scared of.
Drinking warm milk will help you get to sleep.
Come whenever you want.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
Police think the fire was deliberately lit.
The post office is that brown building.
The book you're looking for is on my desk.
She sat on the bed as her mother braided her hair.
There's a hotel across the street.
The museum is not open on Monday.
I love the fact that you always seem to care so much.
She still buys milk.
I thought I could trust you.
I heard the question.
What's your biggest fear?
Thousands of people went to the beach to see the dolphin.
Reaction is not always the best course of action.
The living room adjoins the dining room.
It's started.
He did it willingly.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
That was then and this is now.
How many men named Tom do you know?
Where can I buy some toothpaste?
I have run short of money.
I put some cookies on the table and the kids ate them right up.
I don't expect you to be my friend.
You must do it quickly.
You remind me of your brother.
Our house faces the beach.
I need the money.
I appreciate what you are trying to do.
I want to be doing a good job.
Could you tell me what's going on?
Unless we find some way to drum up more business, bankruptcy will be our only option.
What time did you wake up this morning?
There was once a time when I could not trust others.
I had the same problem when I was your age.
You make me sick.
I bet you know this.
Who wants jello?
Can't he ride a bicycle?
You're the most important person in my life.
I refrain from drinking.
Let me handle this.
What are your responsibilities?
How many times a week do you go shopping at a supermarket?
Tom was asked to be best man at Mary's brother's wedding.
Tom was fast asleep.
He forgave me breaking my promise.
He is afraid of getting lung cancer.
I feel relaxed with you.
As usual, he was the last to arrive at the theater.
How did you make a living in Tokyo?
It was unlocked.
It's just a suggestion.
Does that suit you?
Tom drank lemonade.
That's the eject button. Don't touch it.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
May I call you tomorrow?
It's not every day you get a building named after you.
Did you live here before?
My mom taught me how to do it.
How do you happen to know Tom?
There is a subtle difference between the two words.
You said you were busy.
Very fat people waddle when they walk, though few of them realize it.
For the time being, my sister is an assistant in a supermarket.
Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
Did you buy the medicine?
You get out only what you put in.
May I see your driver's license, sir?
Have you taken your temperature?
I picked you some flowers.
The train was delayed because of heavy snowfall.
Tom hasn't broken any laws.
Don't let Tom do that.
You must be a good cook.
I'll need this.
Tom can't say for sure when Mary will arrive.
I don't see how this changes anything.
The situation went from bad to worse.
The whole family was sick in bed.
He is reading a book.
I got you all right where I want you.
I just started crying.
Tom has decided to major in music.
He doesn't believe in God.
I'm very sorry about the mistake.
She pushed him out the window.
Please stop talking.
He did his best never to think of her.
We're not really sure.
Are you sisters?
He broke his word.
Is this the best you have?
Mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
Is there something you wanted to say?
Tom, I'm happy for you.
Can you believe this is really happening?
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Tom certainly fooled us all.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
We didn't know the whole story at that time.
I'm decorating the classroom.
I don't think it works that way.
I bought this book the other day.
I don't know why Tom didn't do it.
I didn't want to do this in the first place.
You're half right.
What does your spouse like to do that you don't like to do?
I haven't seen you in ages.
Japan is a rich country.
Tom was dressed all in black.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
I thought your parents liked me.
Stop being so nice.
I suppose it might work.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
The students burned their textbooks.
I hadn't expected anyone to be home.
They jumped into the water.
Tom wiped the table clean.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
Where is she?
The boy is tall for his age.
She pushed him out the window.
Call a plumber.
I have to dress up.
Give me your gun.
He's a scriptwriter.
I am calm.
Have you ever argued with your parents?
They had once helped each other.
She began to sing.
I can't come right now.
They rushed towards their mother.
Anybody here?
I know that you and Tom are friends.
I can't stand it that she's suffering so.
We're interested only in the facts.
I didn't think it was a problem.
We don't get many visitors here.
May I come again?
Is anybody here?
You can take it.
I am going in the same direction. Come with me. I will take you there.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Tom went home with Mary.
Did you see that car?
Do you remember how we met?
Everyone is waiting in the other room.
She was happy to be introduced to him at the party.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
He pressed me against the wall.
How old were you when you got married?
I'd like to ask you about a student of yours.
I could really make things hard for you, you know.
I only wish that were possible.
Do you really love me?
He is fresh from college.
It was not an easy decision.
She is a fox.
When are you getting out of here?
We have to change something.
You bought it from Tom, didn't you?
Tom doesn't understand because he wasn't paying attention.
The teacher told them not to swim in the river.
Do you have a house?
What is it you do for a living?
I don't know exactly how or why that happened.
Where's my microphone?
I just don't want anyone to be mad at me.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
What are you doing with these dolls?
He reminded his wife to wake him up at 7:00 a.m.
It's too late to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted.
You have to see it.
You must be very proud of your son.
I swim every day.
You weren't married for long, were you?
Do you understand that?
He drank three glasses of water.
Take off your clothes.
If you ask him, he will help you.
You don't scare me anymore.
You must go.
What floor do you live on?
You lied to Tom.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
Someone has ripped out the first three pages of this book.
I love my kids.
You have to let me help.
He's not supposed to be here.
I can't blame Tom for hating me.
We'll be eating soon.
I just got your message.
I've got someplace I need to be.
I'd like to get a head start.
We want to go.
This happened to us, too.
How's your wife?
Your jeans are dirty.
What's all the fuss?
I saw him cross the road.
Where's your school?
He dozed off in history class.
I'm looking for work.
Is everything okay?
Tom wants to call his uncle, but he can't seem to get a hold of him.
We were startled by the explosion.
They tried to cheer me up.
I was careful to not leave any evidence.
This is a private matter.
I actually saw a ghost.
Prices have gone down.
There were hundreds of people there.
Let's be honest with each other.
You don't understand what's happening.
If you don't want to sing, you don't have to.
Did I not mention that?
May I turn down the TV?
She must have told a lie.
I'm halfway through this crime novel.
How did you come by this painting?
I understand how much you want to go to the party, but I can't let you go.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
I don't know how, but you did it.
I have another good idea.
Are you hurt anywhere?
I love old books.
The students sat in a circle.
He is very fond of music.
Call me if you have any problems.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
I don't see any bruises.
Does truth matter?
It doesn't matter whether you come or not.
Tom has been offered a job in Australia.
I'm not a criminal.
I will devote my life to the study of history.
I'll ask my brother to give me a ride.
I feel like I'm ready for that.
This road leads to Hong Kong.
Lost in thought, I missed my stop.
You have no choice.
I am sure I met him somewhere, but I do not remember who he is.
Why did you get so angry?
She has left her umbrella behind.
We are going to have a baby.
I have no choice but to eat what they serve me.
I believe they're a perfect match.
Remain seated, please.
I strongly advise you to use this.
How did they do that?
No one said anything like that.
I don't want to see you here again.
What'll you do if you can't find enough food to feed your family?
I'd like to come home now.
Forget I said anything.
You're so pathetic.
I feel like I've been cheated.
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
I hear footsteps outside.
I'm a lot more comfortable now.
I listen to jazz sometimes.
You're very sophisticated.
Put a lid on it!
How can you concentrate?
What a wonderful town!
I'm sorry, Tom, I can't do that.
Tom is the one I gave the key to.
I know the truth.
I'm hardworking.
Tom and Mary are a nice couple.
Lightning precedes thunder.
I'm not obese.
Does anyone disagree?
News of the recent blast is all over the radio.
Maybe I shouldn't do that.
Where did the money go?
How did you get these?
She was pleased to see the results.
I know that I can count on you.
The man looked at me.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
You are absolutely right.
Mt. Fuji is noted for its beautiful shape.
My mother makes cakes.
Why don't you take a seat here?
Once you've formed a bad habit, you can't get rid of it easily.
I knew there was a reason.
Tom and Mary told me they had a good time at the concert.
It was a quiet night.
Reading books will make you smarter.
They'll never know.
You should look that word up.
You lied to me.
You're funny.
The exit will be on the left.
I can't say I'm terribly proud of what I did.
Who'd want to hire Tom?
I think it's good for you to read this book.
Remember to brush your teeth.
You are not a doctor.
This is not true.
Tom is respected in the business community because he is always fair and square in his dealings with others.
Here is a present for your birthday.
I have backstage passes.
He attempted to climb the fence to no avail.
I don't know anything about it at all.
I'm very impressed.
Wait for me in the car.
I am going to leave my present job.
Tom, someone is here to see you.
I have three times as many books as Tom does.
I'm still waiting for my order.
I had an interesting day today.
How deep is Lake Biwa?
I tuck my children into bed every night.
I feel completely restored after a week in the country.
Grab the end of this rope.
I want to spend more time alone with you.
I've done everything I was supposed to do.
I didn't think you'd tell me.
Let's not wait for the others.
You can spend the night at our place.
I didn't really want to win.
Are you enjoying it?
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
Many lives were lost.
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
They despise you.
I'd like to brush my teeth.
Tom told me he wanted to meet my parents.
Don't talk to me like that.
I watched an old movie on TV.
I should've done it when I had the chance.
It's only money.
His patience is worn out.
As we go up higher, the air becomes thinner.
It's so nice to stay at home.
Should I tell Tom to ask Mary to sing?
Did you have your photograph taken for the driver's license?
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
Please remain seated.
I fail to understand his true aim.
I have to admit that you're right.
Don't speak so fast.
There's nothing more to say.
The cellar is ugly, dark, and stinky.
I'll miss this place once I leave.
You may injure yourself if you don't follow safety procedures.
I didn't know whether I wanted to go to university.
I have fewer books than you.
Prices have been rising steadily.
I didn't want to believe it myself.
We can't escape.
He has the least money of us all.
Tom doesn't know how much Mary weighs.
I like playing golf.
Don't let your mother know that.
I'm sick of lying.
I don't have any close friends.
Divide and conquer.
The folder is empty.
You may take this book as long as you keep it clean.
Do you agree?
Do you think she's attractive?
Why are you scared?
Thanks to all of you.
Tom doesn't really know how to ski very well.
Are you looking for your parents?
There are many beautiful parks in London.
I don't care about any of that.
I don't care where we eat dinner. It's entirely up to you.
You should turn off your cell phone.
How long ago was that?
All the rooms are taken.
I'm not in a rush.
Is he still here?
I think it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to do that by yourself.
He negotiated a lower price with the real estate agent.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?
We exchanged greetings.
Do you plan to go abroad?
Tom is on the phone.
She would not disclose the secret.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
Let in some fresh air.
I went to school on foot in those days.
I've had the time of my life.
Don't just stand there, say something.
I slept all day.
Turn off the radio.
It's your book.
I don't like either tea or coffee.
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be.
I don't get it.
You were beginning to worry me.
The clock is ticking.
I had to walk because there were no taxis.
They came last week.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
What's our destination?
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up?
Doctors save lives.
Why don't you return to your quarters?
I'm going over to my sister's.
I can remember when you were just a little girl.
Are you seeing anybody right now?
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
What foods are you allergic to?
I am glad that you have succeeded.
Tom looks very anxious.
She's got a point.
You have my word.
He failed the exam.
Tom seems to want to help Mary.
The boys were as nervous as the girls.
Is this a compliment?
I have to start somewhere.
Put away your wallet.
She has totally changed her character.
The two generals met again the next day.
Please knock before you come in.
He took advantage of the good weather to do some gardening.
Your cat is fat.
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
Allow me to explain.
A cat appeared from under the desk.
He played the guitar and she played the piano.
Tom was thinking of going to New York.
I told Tom to take off his shoes.
His grandfather died of cancer last year.
It was just a lucky guess.
I'll never leave you.
Are you traveling alone?
Women in that country are fighting for their freedom.
Put on your pajamas and go to bed.
That was totally amazing.
Don't change your mind so often.
No one is amused.
I never wanted to harm you.
Don't be so negative.
A doctor told me that eating eggs was bad for me.
I'm afraid this key does not fit.
I usually agree with Tom.
Read this first.
There's a rumor in the air that the firm is going into bankruptcy.
I don't have a badge.
We should decide today.
We ran after the thief.
This sounds fishy.
Does Tom still buy you nice things?
I want you in my office in one hour.
He likes adventure.
It is not necessary for you to quit the job.
I would rather stay at home than go out.
I said nothing.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
We were proud of our strength.
We can't protect you.
You don't seem very sure.
I thought you'd be happy.
It won't be long before they get married.
Lemons are sour.
She may spill the beans.
You should have known better.
Who were you dreaming about?
You're old enough to know better.
That's exactly what I thought.
You don't seem convinced.
He kept waiting for hours and hours.
Don't ask questions. Just follow orders.
Did you go to Tom's party last Saturday?
Tom drank too much.
Three of the men involved in the accident were hospitalized.
That's just what I need right now.
I'm beginning to lose patience with Tom.
"I can make it to my class on time," he thought.
Give me one good reason.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
I'm beautiful.
I saw a light far away.
That's not our only problem.
She has about 2,000 books.
It's a beautiful night for a swim, don't you think?
Your effort will surely bear fruit.
He moved close to her.
It just came out.
They live on the floor beneath.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Let's call a spade a spade.
Why don't you run for student council?
We'll try not to let it happen again.
Tom found his new job interesting.
There is very little probability of an agreement being reached.
He sat there with his legs crossed.
The defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
We were all wondering why you were late.
I can't stand it any longer.
Tom had a knife.
Grammar is a very complex thing.
I'd like you to meet my wife.
She's playing Monopoly.
It was just a passing infatuation.
Tom doesn't know the difference between an adjective and an adverb.
Are you going to warn Tom?
Let Tom stay home.
That's her.
She tried to conceal the fact.
I'd like to see the car before I rent it.
Are you happy?
Is this wine from Argentina?
Let's just say I'm here to stay.
I used to have a girlfriend.
Be very careful.
I want to make one thing clear.
I love this song.
What's the weather like today?
We need to study more.
You don't have to apologize.
Kabuki is an old Japanese art.
Tom tried in vain to hide his pain.
You have my permission.
I felt a sudden pain in my side.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
I asked my mother to wake me up at four.
I can't do without an air conditioner in the summer.
She advised him to go to the police station.
That's a good story.
Don't put the saddle on the wrong horse.
Don't forget your sunscreen.
I'm not the least bit worried about losing my job.
They have plenty of water.
I guess it's possible.
I'll put you out of your misery.
I get along with everyone.
It's no trouble at all.
They don't understand me when I speak German.
I used to take a walk every morning.
You don't have to come.
This is your hat, isn't it?
I had a bad summer.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
How many times do I need to repeat it?
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
What has happened to the book I put here a few moments ago?
My sister's going to kill me.
Anyone can do that.
When do you mean to start?
The train is 30 minutes overdue.
Quit acting like a baby.
Don't ask for money.
The two men were business partners.
If you only had one more week to live, what would you spend your time doing?
Words failed her.
I had my doubts about you.
Are you looking for somebody?
She told us the road was closed.
I realized that even though I wanted to eat, I didn't have enough time.
I am not interested in material gain.
I was 13 at the time.
Open the safe.
Do you have many friends here in Japan?
It wasn't an accident.
We ate swordfish.
Is lunch ready?
My mother left me a message.
Can I get your attention, please?
Don't you like fish?
I don't know why I have to do this.
Don't be so choosy.
I think he is a doctor.
Why are you alone?
Speak for yourself.
Dry the pants on the radiator.
Do you think the shooting was accidental?
Write me.
Yeah, you could be right.
Talk to my boss.
I said it as a joke.
This cloth feels like velvet.
Why are you so hard-headed?
I think you should reconsider this.
The dog looks sick.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
I attempted to solve the problem.
Do you have an appointment?
I'll call you later today.
His face was covered with mud.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I need to pay the rent.
I thought this was a hospital.
How did they manage that?
What is wrong with him?
He is good at driving.
Give it to me.
Have you ever studied archaeology?
I suppose you think I'm rich.
I think the movie is almost over.
Can you read that?
I'm not so sure anymore.
Please mail this form to your insurance company.
That's a true story.
You're not that interesting.
Can you imagine what life will be like for them now?
How do you know what I had?
When are you going to come?
His youngest son is five years old.
The old lady was kind enough to show me the way to the station.
Would you mind paying this time?
I was horrified.
I don't believe it happened that way.
They looked very happy.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
The steak is well done.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Tom has trouble fitting in.
We remained silent.
Stop shooting.
Could you please lend me your dictionary?
I'm not a gambler.
I let him sleep at my house for the night.
Does any other country fan the flames of patriotism as much as America?
I don't tell people what to eat.
Call me after you talk to Tom.
I want them all shot.
Don't you have anything else?
I can't carry on like this.
Business is very good now.
Can you climb the tree?
One of the fellows you were with is a friend of mine.
I love the outfit you're wearing.
They made fun of Mary.
What's going to happen that's so terrible?
I'm rational.
Mistakes were made.
I went to Europe before the war.
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?
I had the door repaired.
I don't like silence.
I remember saying that.
Can't you hear the sound?
He painted the door blue.
How much is this tie?
I am looking for my brother.
The police want to question you.
This is the man I've been waiting for.
I know how to do it.
Let's have lunch here.
He gave me what money he had with him.
Go to the barber.
I wish you had come with us.
It made sense.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
May I accompany you to the airport?
I was really anxious.
My father and I played tennis on Sunday.
She told him that she didn't love him.
You can get a car license after you turn eighteen.
He drew a chair near her.
Tom has a sister.
I don't live with Tom.
The moon is the earth's only satellite.
You can't just quit.
You nearly died.
He is good at voicing the concerns others are too nervous to speak up about.
They are reading their newspapers.
I'm beginning to feel stupid.
You've got bags under your eyes.
In American football, a touchdown scores six points.
It was fun while it lasted.
No one's prepared.
She thought of a good way to make money on the Internet.
You drive a hard bargain.
We don't need you anymore.
When did you go to work?
You aren't supposed to swim here.
He always looked happy, but never was.
I've never seen one like that.
How many people were killed in the store?
I don't drink that much beer.
Show me another watch.
I know exactly where I am.
Stop acting like a child.
They work in the fields.
Do you miss your kids?
Here is their photo album.
How are you two doing?
It's a good school.
Last year saw a big political change in Japan.
You are too late.
I like neither of them.
She's a single mother of two.
Tom was impatient to see Mary again.
He's in the shower.
Tom didn't attend class last week.
Let me try that.
The cat is licking itself.
I was expecting the worst.
I have problems concentrating.
No one can deny the fact that fire burns.
Prices are stable these days.
Is it something you can get rid of?
Neither of his students passed the exam.
I don't like your attitude.
Tom couldn't do something like that.
I'd like to talk with you.
This looks longer than that, but it is an optical illusion.
How do you account for that?
What we should do next is the question.
It will not make much difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
I'm allergic to seafood.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
You can use my bicycle.
I thought it might be useful.
Tom asked me to marry him.
Don't say it in a roundabout way.
An Englishman would not pronounce it like that.
Have you ever had lunch at this restaurant?
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Tom started yelling.
I've never had a friend quite like you.
Tom doesn't like to lend his books to Mary.
Tom refused to take the money.
Not everyone agrees with you.
She argued with him about money.
We need some help here.
It's what you deserve.
I won't be running for mayor.
I like your painting.
We don't always agree.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
It was to be expected.
I'm leaving you tomorrow.
I've got no worries.
I think you must be tired.
I didn't want it to happen.
Tom was upstairs.
Mary is going to open a gift from her boyfriend.
I wish you'd stop saying that.
I want to talk with you.
It took exactly an hour.
I'm too tired to argue.
Tom was sitting at a nearby table.
Our country's climate is temperate.
Is it true that Tom won the race?
This couch is not comfortable.
What are some foods you usually eat with a knife and fork?
Everyone looked at him like he was crazy.
Would you like to go see a movie with me?
I think Tom is wrong.
I failed to recall the song's title.
You're all against me.
He had been there for ten years before he came to Kyoto.
You get out only what you put in.
Let's do something different this afternoon.
You've been had.
He gave up hope.
Let me write down the address.
I know Tom lied.
Were you hurt?
Should I wait for you tomorrow in front of the opera house?
He kept badgering her until she told him what he wanted to know.
It's nothing special.
You're new here, aren't you?
We saw her enter the room.
Is this your umbrella?
Tom wouldn't let anybody help him.
They're able to sing.
You'd make a good counselor.
In my opinion, a well-designed website shouldn't require horizontal scrolling.
She divorced him last year.
If it is sunny tomorrow, we will go on a picnic.
Ladies and gentlemen, please come this way.
I don't watch a lot of movies, but I can't resist a good documentary.
They stayed at a five-star hotel.
I don't care how long it takes.
He will be here soon.
What does an airship look like?
Everything's all right now.
Did you stay home to study for the test?
Aren't you going to take your coat off?
I'll have this radio fixed tomorrow.
The sales of this model took off.
She may have told me a lie.
Okay, I'm ready.
Why don't we go home?
It looks really good.
I think it's time for me to call a doctor.
I don't remember anything happening.
When did your friend leave for America?
You must realize that by now.
You had better prepare for the future.
We tried to cheer him up.
You can get a loan from a bank.
Ask your dad to help you.
I should've warned you.
Could I borrow your car?
Do you want children?
We're not invited.
Tom was just great.
I don't want to think about what could have happened.
I'm really hungry. I haven't eaten all week.
He commanded me to shut the gate.
Tom managed to do everything he was supposed to do.
She and her friends love music.
I could've done that.
I want you to stay here with her.
All you had to do was ask.
You don't have to go to the party if you don't want to.
No one agreed with him.
I'd like to be as rich as Tom is.
It's just the two of us.
What languages do they speak in Korea?
We were just about to leave when she telephoned.
Few people came to the lecture.
Freedom is not free.
Your father is tall.
I had him repair my watch.
Who are you and why are you here?
Please keep this door locked.
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
Is it complicated?
Do your parents know about this?
I thought you'd gone and left me.
I was thinking about the plan.
Why do I believe you?
I wasn't following the conversation.
Your daughter overheard us talking.
They have three double rooms left.
Our train stopped suddenly.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
I don't have the address with me.
Go to your room.
Which is mine?
How long have you been waiting for the bus?
This is what he painted.
Tom didn't want me to sell my old truck.
Tom will cry.
You said you didn't understand.
It's already late.
It's a small world.
Tom could learn a thing or two from Mary.
Why are you so happy?
Tom went to Boston for a week.
The dog was dead.
Hand it over.
Show me your hands.
I'm innocent.
More than 10,000 people signed the petition.
I've always considered you a close friend.
Please show me what to do next.
It wasn't me.
This is not a good sign.
We were eating eggs.
Tom has two brothers who live in Boston.
I've never ridden a horse.
Could you give me some examples?
I hope that you feel better tomorrow.
I can't believe you let this happen.
Who hid my suspenders?
I have to go and buy a newspaper.
Nobody knows this.
It wasn't all that bad.
I'll study harder from now on.
Have you ever seen her?
Cats can see in the dark.
It's a good camera.
That helped.
Is this a bad time to chat?
How soon are you going shopping?
I guess you never learned how to do this.
He works at a bank.
You're free to go.
Why did they hire you?
The high-profile kidnapping has captivated the nation.
I am going to buy a new car.
We all have kids.
Tom denied having stolen the money.
Eat and drink.
That's not fair and you know it.
This hotel is better than the other one.
We went to the park to take pictures.
Life begins at forty.
Tom loved teaching French.
Do you have any aspirin on you?
He is about my age.
This won't happen again.
I said yes.
You're talented.
They concluded he was lying.
I know just what you need.
Brush your teeth.
Tom greeted us warmly.
Don't worry about it!
I moved into a new apartment.
What do you think you'd like to do next time?
Let's see what happens.
Was the movie interesting?
English is studied in China, too.
I overslept so I was late to school.
You scare me.
Why do you want to do this?
I thought you had to get up by 7:30.
Tom is nervous and excited.
I don't want to talk about it further.
He cannot play guitar.
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
I took it for granted that you would come.
You're not listening!
She could always call her parents when she was in a crunch.
Look in the mirror.
Nobody backed up what I said.
He has a butler and a cook.
I need more gold.
They were very hungry.
How did you get in here?
She couldn't convince him to write a song for her.
Here's a big map of Germany.
They decided on the date and location of their wedding.
I looked around and noticed that mine was the only car on the road.
What he said is a good idea.
He was checking you out.
Be careful, Tom!
I just want to get some sleep.
Tom is very unhappy.
I was fired in 2013.
Is this a pen or a pencil?
Tom's parents wanted him to study harder.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
Tom left his briefcase on the subway.
You shouldn't go to school.
I wear shorts all the time.
My watch loses five minutes a day.
I got what you needed.
Your problem is you're not patient enough.
They love each other deeply.
I can't walk any farther.
Do you like Moscow?
Could I have the check?
Old habits are hard to break.
He begged us to go with him.
I always got up early in my childhood.
I dealt with it.
He will come tomorrow.
I explained to the host that I had been delayed by a traffic jam.
Would you like coffee with your dessert?
I had a sandwich for lunch.
We can't do this without you.
Are you ready to begin?
Look here.
It's going really well.
Both Tom and Mary are teachers.
Job security became a major worry.
Let's not kid ourselves.
The mouse ran underneath the bed.
Would you mind closing the door behind you?
He felt a sharp pain in his chest.
I thought I was going crazy.
Let's be best friends forever.
The mayor didn't like what the journalists wrote.
Don't bother waking me up at 4:00 a.m. I don't plan to go fishing tomorrow.
Let's not argue.
This must be a mistake.
Hunger is the best sauce.
Get them out of my sight.
This book hasn't yet been translated into French.
I want to shake your hand.
That problem is too simple.
Pray for all of us.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
I have a very busy schedule today.
It's too late to do anything about that now.
We did have fun together, didn't we?
What is it made of?
Scallops are on sale today.
He ran into the classroom.
I want to go over it again in more detail.
Can you buy one for me as well?
I noticed her hands shaking.
I haven't gotten paid yet.
Could you get in touch with him?
You're thin.
Tom can't use this.
I'll be with you in just a second.
I wish he had attended the meeting.
You have such beautiful, hazel eyes.
He lost his life in a traffic accident.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I do that all the time.
Even though my friend was a vegetarian, I didn't tell him that the soup had some meat in it.
How certain are you that he's a criminal?
They arrived here safely yesterday.
I know that this is the first time this has happened to you.
None of us knew the answer.
He did not turn up after all.
You're lucky that you have a job.
I'm still intimidated by you.
Nobody's forcing you to stay.
I hope we'll see each other again sometime.
Where does this doodad go?
I would like to leave this town and never come back.
How much is it including insurance and tax?
I can't explain what happened.
I really can't figure it out.
I heard someone call my name.
You know what they say.
His sisters as well as he are now living in Kyoto.
It took them some time to get used to each other.
We discussed the subject at length.
That made me laugh.
Tom asked Mary several questions.
I'll understand if you don't want to go there with me.
The Nozomi is the fastest of all the trains in Japan.
I don't speak French, but I can understand it a bit.
Can you hold the elevator, please?
I never get invited to parties.
He has already had lunch.
Breakfast is served from 7:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.
No one comes to visit me anymore.
The evidence is overwhelming.
Could you get in touch with him?
She found employment as a typist.
I'm in way over my head.
I made these.
I have nothing to do with it.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
He went fishing in the river.
I think it's time for me to sharpen my pencil.
The cold weather extended into April.
He disregarded my advice.
I don't remember being given a choice.
Tom says he's planning on buying a gift for Mary.
Bad weather prevented them from sailing.
I don't require assistance.
We want to know the facts.
Coastal cities will take the brunt of the storm.
No one knew Tom was there.
I can easily touch my toes.
I'm one of your students.
Liars must have a good memory.
Are you still scared?
I think that he's probably not a bad boy.
I want many things.
He denied it.
Let go of the handle.
Give it to me, please.
The hills were covered with snow.
Do you like to be kept waiting?
Take a number.
I knocked, but no one opened the door.
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
We talked about what we could do.
I'd like to graduate next spring.
Tom gave his dog a hug.
She made an excuse for being late.
I have a few friends in Boston.
Who are you talking to?
Trust me.
Tom was shorter than me when we were kids.
Why are you so insecure?
I'm looking for my mobile phone.
Are you sure there's nothing else to drink?
It's so simple that even a child can do it.
You have good taste in music.
Add a tiny pinch of salt.
Culture plays a dynamic role in shaping an individual's character, attitude, and outlook on life.
I declined for personal reasons.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
You enjoyed that, didn't you?
This is unbearable.
She is a real beauty.
I don't know if they still live there.
Is Tom OK?
His mother is worried about him.
That's all I want to say.
The population of Tokyo is greater than that of London.
Today I don't feel like doing anything.
Yes. That's right.
The police kept looking for a stolen article for about one month.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I feel more alert after drinking a cup of coffee.
She needed the entire afternoon to complete the work.
You were hurt, weren't you?
Nobody is too old to learn.
We watch television every evening.
We're experienced.
I thought you'd got lost.
What's your favorite song to dance to?
Get me some coffee.
I tried to run fast.
This is an ancient law.
He dislocated his shoulder.
I'll never be able to do that without your help.
Speaking English is difficult.
He fell into a deep slumber.
Can it really be this bad?
Your singing puts professional singers to shame.
It's too thin.
Just close your eyes.
That was such good a book that I read it three times.
She advised him against doing it.
I have a reservation for today.
I think it's time for me to lose some weight.
Do you want to hang with us?
Everybody does that.
Most students study hard.
I feel a little responsible.
I was kidnapped.
I wish you would tell me what I ought to do in this difficult situation.
How dare you say such things about me!
You are very rich.
What if they don't like me?
They're all gone.
Look at the clock.
The swimmers were numb with cold.
I'll leave it up to you.
Tom never gets invited to parties.
I'm from Tokyo.
I want to want what you want.
What illness do I have?
The old man tends to exaggerate.
He told the truth.
How did you learn to speak French so well?
I make a good living.
Wash your hands first.
I think something terrible has happened to Tom.
Tom made the same mistake again.
Get down.
I let go of the rope.
He makes it a rule to write in his diary every day.
Reading books is very interesting.
You're very upset.
A true gentleman never betrays his friends.
Is there something wrong with your phone?
You won't regret this. I promise.
He has a good record as a businessman.
You're very attractive.
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
It is foggy.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.
That's the way I like it.
She choked him with her bare hands.
Mary is a formidable woman.
Tom didn't want to come here, but he came anyway.
Don't you feel guilty?
I need you to leave now.
Don't talk to your father like that.
Shut the door, please.
I just want to watch this.
How long did I sleep?
It was not until I reached home that I missed my purse.
This is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
May I talk to you?
I cut the article out of the magazine.
Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
I get up at six.
You're not that interesting.
Tom can't win.
I didn't cause the explosion.
I've been away too long already.
We're not the champions.
Tell her you like her. Don't be afraid. She won't bite you.
I'd like to confirm the departure time.
I hate to interrupt, but I need to say something.
Over 30 people committed suicide.
My house is on a hill.
I'm very disappointed in you.
It'll be invisible.
Tom is a dancing teacher.
Keep your eyes peeled!
I understand how to solve the problem.
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.
Everything was stolen.
Nice timing.
That's right!
I'm glad to see you again.
Why are you flinching?
We were outnumbered.
Don't kid me!
Go to the store.
I'm hoarse from yelling so much.
You're being bossy, aren't you?
Are you being followed?
I may need to move on.
You're very timid.
I like women.
Are you Chinese or Japanese?
Tom put a bandage on Mary's finger.
Where do you keep the booze?
I can't show you.
Come on, help me.
Doctors removed the bullet.
I did everything I could to stop Tom.
I really want to see you.
You don't have to go.
He explained the plan's main objective.
I just don't want to discuss it right now.
Someone has stolen our clothes.
They just want someone they can blame.
Is this your briefcase?
He's away on vacation.
Tell me what I should be watching for.
We're finally alone.
I guess that's OK.
Think of what you are reading while you are reading it.
She tried a third time.
Do you have more than one copy of this key?
I refuse to give up on this.
Do you have any one dollar bills?
Are you ready now?
What did you think I meant?
Who's your father?
Have you already read this book?
She went to see him reluctantly.
He's the captain of a team.
By the way, have you seen him lately?
What do you think of this hat?
Come along with us.
The gunman was found to be insane.
They had no money left.
Go ahead. I'll meet you downstairs.
Tom is good at diving.
I believe it will snow tomorrow.
I'll go back.
You're a man now.
He always keeps his word.
Tom hasn't said a word.
What's wrong with him?
I'm looking forward to the party.
He's just like his grandfather.
How can I become rich?
At first, I didn't know what to do.
Do you want this done quickly or do you want this done right?
This law applies to everybody.
Are you over your cold yet?
You look very pale.
It appeared that he meant what he said.
I fell in love with you.
I can't believe he kissed you.
Do you want something?
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
I remember that I closed the door.
What part of Australia are you from?
He said that it was nine o'clock.
He was accused of squandering public funds.
He never speaks unless spoken to.
I grew up eating Japanese food.
He threatened me, but I wasn't scared.
The police uncovered a major drug operation.
I lost my favorite pen.
Their answer is no.
Several people are sleeping in the next room.
I asked my teacher what to do next.
She left the baby crying.
Give me a ring tomorrow.
You might want to try it sometime.
I have appendicitis.
This is a heartwarming movie.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
They'll tell you the truth.
I wrote it for Tom.
I am not the captain of the new team.
It would've been nice if Tom had told us he'd be late.
Where are my hiking boots?
That type of person almost never asks for a raise.
Do you like music?
I forgot to ask him.
I've got to get ready for school.
I pretended to work.
Was the movie interesting?
I like the way you treat me.
I refuse.
She was cleaning the house in preparation for a party.
I captured butterflies with a net.
I'm tired of waiting.
Tom is going to go to Boston next weekend.
Are you blushing?
What's the hurry?
You don't have to go.
She lived to be ninety.
He is a simple man.
Excuse me for interrupting you, but would you mind opening the window?
I wish you were here with me now.
That cheese is made from goat's milk.
Today's Tom's birthday.
I don't see the problem.
I remember.
Something in his face really reminded me of an old boyfriend of mine.
I must say I'm flattered.
Tom is an active person.
Let's stop talking and start working.
Tom is worried about his children.
I have to go back to the office.
Where's the book I need?
You can't drink the water here.
We ran short of money.
Do you let your children drink coffee?
I don't remember what happened.
He returned home without telling us.
How very curious!
I had a fantastic time at your party.
I can't open this jar.
They went whale watching.
I don't hate you.
Why don't you come visit us?
I gave in to temptation and began to smoke a cigarette.
What am I supposed to do with them?
Always keep your workplace organized.
She asked him where he lived, but he was too smart to tell her.
I can't say that didn't hurt.
Don't you see what you've become?
She didn't want him to leave the room.
I think it's the best way.
You can trust them.
I'll study your report.
He will be ready.
Tom is always present.
The attempt ended in failure.
You have our respect.
May I keep this photograph?
She's wearing eye shadow.
It is good to be a winner.
Tom wants to work with Mary.
I thought my parents would be proud of me.
I've been waiting for you for a long time.
I'm famous.
It was shorter than she expected.
This is the magazine I spoke to you about.
Tom is speaking.
That's all we're offering.
You can borrow my car anytime.
You're very good.
I wish you hadn't found me.
You could count to ten when you were two years old.
I'll be busy all next week.
She was ashamed of herself for her carelessness.
I don't think I can help you.
I'd like to live in the suburbs of Kobe.
He concentrated on that.
I am so sick.
Of all these books, this is by far the best on China.
I think you look hot.
I need you right now.
Don't open the door for anybody.
The government has imposed a new tax on wine.
They're in the science lab.
I'm sure Tom was involved.
I want to fly above the clouds.
Thanks for your cooperation.
He sat reading a book.
You're not very good.
Sometimes it's not so simple.
Don't try to do too much.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
We don't need your money.
The press can't ignore us forever. Sooner or later, they'll do a story about us.
I was born prematurely.
She earns more than she spends.
I envy him.
Would you like to take part in this risky experiment?
I wouldn't think of it.
Those glasses suit you.
Do you understand that?
He does it faster than me.
I don't want to work at a supermarket all my life.
You look so beautiful.
I got there ahead of time.
Is the procedure clear?
It's so simple that even a child can do it.
You may go.
I did it for him.
I never expected that she would join us.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Please help me take this lid off.
When will he be busy?
Don't waste my time asking stupid questions.
Tom had his wisdom teeth taken out by a twenty-four year old dentist.
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth.
Please remember to mail the letter.
I'm sure everything will be fine.
What a beautiful scene!
Please don't distract me from my work.
Tom spends all his time on the computer.
How are you connected?
That's what bothers me.
He asked me for my phone number.
Where can I buy stamps?
English is pretty hard, isn't it?
I'd like to talk with you about your grades.
I can do it.
What can I get you?
How come you know so much?
I've come here to help you.
I never drink at home.
He is the only child they have.
It was his own fault.
The attack began without enough planning.
You have to go.
I will go along with you as far as the station.
They're here for me.
He has a hairy chest.
He wants to marry my daughter.
You need not have come so early.
I'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow.
They were very kind to me.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
They want to kill me.
It makes me feel dirty.
Are you happy here?
I like her very much.
Anyone can make mistakes.
I shouldn't have to tell you to do your homework.
There's a lot to do.
I love hanging out with you.
Don't make me do it.
I saw it on TV.
Who is the manager?
Do I have to pay you?
I have standards.
She drinks a little wine at times.
Tom says he needs to talk with you.
I'll monitor your progress from my computer.
French is a difficult language.
Armenian is an Indo-European language.
You can't have both books.
I knew this was a bad idea.
We invited him to the party, but he did not show up.
You don't seem too sure.
I often played soccer when I was young.
I am a college student.
The two ladies smiled at each other.
That's a plan.
You look happy.
He is about your age.
I'm being treated like a child.
Are you free tomorrow?
Could you call again later, please?
Tom sipped some tea.
You're very wise.
She became drowsy after supper.
Don't ever talk to me again.
Do you plan to buy that car?
What did Tom sing at your wedding?
She bought him a dog. However, he was allergic to dogs, so they had to give it away.
My brother is in Australia now.
Have you checked the suggestions box today?
Come to my office.
I appeal to you to contribute to the new clinic.
I thought you were hungry.
What could they possibly want from us?
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't walk alone after dark.
He makes mistakes like everyone else.
I was really quite stiff.
Are you leaving now?
How is the weather?
Wait here till I come back.
Drink some water.
We have no one but ourselves to blame for that.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
He is as tall as my brother.
He's not rich, but he's happy.
I wonder what Tom would do.
Is college worth it?
Physics is my weak subject.
She sent him a postcard.
You must be cautious.
I really appreciate your coming.
He's too old for me.
Someone will do this job.
It's awesome.
Tom had a heart tattooed on his arm.
How does this disease spread?
How strong he is!
I suggest that you try to get some sleep.
This is extremely hard.
It was frustrating.
A lot of these are Tom's.
You look upset.
I could see Tokyo Tower far away.
Our school is near the station.
We're not so sure.
Here we are!
They're too fat.
I guess that's all I need to know.
Tom opened the window a crack.
Tom's dead.
I have a small gift for you.
I've been a ski instructor for three years.
Tom and Mary are giving a party on Friday night.
Did you plant pumpkins this year?
We've had a lot of storms this winter.
He works at night.
Tom isn't like us.
Can you believe it?
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
I think this table takes up too much space.
Mars has a very thin atmosphere.
I apologized.
That's what I'm always telling Tom.
Where's my ticket?
Don't go without a hat.
I think we'd better be going.
Can you talk about that a little?
Let's take it down a notch.
He had been walking for hours.
You're not fast enough.
We must do this right now.
I understood it perfectly.
I can't find anybody to ask.
I don't know if I can make it to your party or not.
I may give it another try.
He was my student. Now he teaches my children.
I'll protect Tom.
I used my imagination.
My computer's acting up.
In terms of the pay you will get, is this a good job?
Bring the frozen fish here.
Prices are lower in Kobe.
He was tired so he went to bed.
She had been sick for a week when I visited her.
This works.
Are you sure you don't know Tom?
Tom was bleeding heavily.
What were they doing here?
It's more difficult than you think.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
Tom tried to tell me something.
Scream as loud as you can.
He left his wife.
It's necessary for you to go.
Because my mother is sick, my father will cook today.
There's a table.
Don't you recognize that man?
I saw them.
I'm looking for a house.
Was that another joke?
I never drink beer before lunch.
You didn't tell me that you were a doctor.
Can I sit down?
It looks good on you.
Tom likes ponies.
That could be helpful.
You don't have to answer.
So what're you saying?
I'm happy to see you in one piece.
We've endured three wars.
This isn't what I wanted.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
She was asked to the party.
Things are not looking good.
It's a sunny day.
You can't just keep throwing your money away on this kind of thing.
He is as tall as his father.
I don't want this shirt.
She forced him to sit down.
Tom clearly lied.
She gave him a present.
We try to go to Boston at least once a year.
Sing me a song.
They had once helped each other.
Why did you kill the snake?
I did what I was told.
We can't protect Tom indefinitely.
I don't have the money to buy that book.
I played video games after I finished my homework.
All the answers to this question were wrong.
He had no memory of the accident.
I want to know what you think.
We won't use that.
I want you to stop following me.
May I ask a stupid question?
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain. Are you really already exhausted?
Are you kidding me?
How can you be so sure?
The girl let the bird go.
Be nicer to your sister.
I'm not happy.
Tell Tom what you mean.
I had no idea we had so much in common.
I thought the game was over.
That's my cat.
It has become noticeably colder.
I've got accustomed to speaking in public.
I don't want to lose my boyfriend.
He has made me what I am today.
I'm not dying.
Could you do me a favor?
If that is true, then he is not responsible for the accident.
It's about time the government did something about pollution.
This was a great idea.
I made very short work of the big steak.
Is that seriously what you think?
You two are really kind.
Can I open the window?
Tom is out of breath.
Our music teacher advised me to visit Vienna.
Don't give up the fight.
How can we thank you?
Can't you help us?
You're not getting any younger.
What was in it for you?
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
He invested his money in stocks.
Are you better now?
I just followed the recipe.
Tom noticed several differences.
Tom wants to speak.
Didn't I tell you not to do that anymore?
We have known each other since childhood.
Don't let anything else distract us.
I showed him the way.
Will there be any permanent damage?
There's a long line at every cash register.
He acts like he knows everything.
I feel like singing.
Tom is really fast, isn't he?
It sounds familiar.
May I talk to you a minute?
She mistook me for my brother.
The furniture in this office is really modern.
She persuaded him to marry her.
I didn't realize you were awake.
A laptop is better than a desktop.
He accomplishes whatever he sets out to do.
I know your brother.
I know that he keeps his promise.
The time has come for you to play your trump card.
Have you made any friends yet?
Do you know how to count to ten in French?
I'm aware of the risks.
The kids are making too much noise.
I wonder where to hang this picture that Tom gave me.
You made me proud.
Who's the boy swimming over there?
Tom brushed his daughter's hair.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
Did you understand me?
People are not always what they seem.
Both of the brothers are still living.
I need some sugar to make a cake.
How did you do this?
He was covered with sweat.
Tom doesn't like pizza.
I didn't know you were such a good cook.
I was able to succeed because of your advice.
They left the problem unsolved.
Tom had a good reason for being late.
It's an ambitious project.
Can I set a place at the table for you?
Are cats smarter than dogs?
You always say the same thing.
Can you afford it?
This is the strangest thing I've ever done.
There is no salt left.
You gotta get more organized.
They want to know what's going on.
I disobeyed you.
I love talking to you.
I would like chicken soup.
I don't care who you're going with.
His wife is our Italian teacher.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Where's your dog?
Where is the mailbox?
At first, I couldn't play the guitar.
That was mentioned.
I have a proposition for you.
I don't think I can do it.
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus.
I want my hammer back.
I talk to myself.
We'll try to be more careful the next time.
My father is sweeping the garage.
You didn't have to lie.
This room smells musty.
The statue has no head.
I just got up.
Could you get me some cough drops?
I remember everything you tell me.
I know what they said.
I like that job.
That's a plan.
His new movie is disappointing.
Mother bought me a new bicycle.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
You're a thief.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
Would you please keep the noise down?
She stopped talking.
Black looks good on you.
Helen Keller was blind, deaf and dumb.
He became rich through hard work.
Something went terribly wrong.
Tom is apparently a truck driver.
Tom had no choice but to stay.
If you touch that wire, you will receive a shock.
Don't worry.
I don't have the right equipment.
I'll call you a cab.
Everyone's still asleep.
Breakfast is served.
I did you a favor.
Thanks for saving me.
She urged him to consider the request.
Carry her to the operating room.
This sentence needs to be checked.
She'll try it once more.
Did you get the flowers?
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
Governments should not be in the business of legislating morality.
How many audiobooks do you have on your mobile MP3 player?
I want to drink a cup of tea.
That's all I need to hear.
Come join us.
We're all hungry.
Clearly, this is the most important point.
I think we're going to need more money.
"In my opinion," said the younger brother, "you are wrong."
This is a good textbook.
Is this the reason you didn't want me to come?
He explained it at length.
I think I look fat in these jeans.
She advised him to stop smoking.
I'm afraid I didn't explain it too well.
I saw Tom tonight.
He likes geography and history.
He was busy getting ready for his journey.
Blood poured from the cut vein.
I don't care for that sort of thing.
Tom was the only one who got injured.
His voice is pleasant to listen to.
Can you please stop singing?
We're all right now.
Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.
You're the only person I know besides me who is actually interested in this kind of thing.
How much more work do you have?
Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task.
I have to be back home by seven.
Write something.
The telephone rang.
I'm not doing that today.
Where can I go to buy art books and catalogs?
We are concerned about our planet.
He fell into the river.
This is Tom's computer.
We saw you.
Right at that instant, the bus stopped.
It's self-explanatory.
You must start at once.
Perhaps we should talk in my office.
Be careful, there are cougars in this area.
I have no will power when it comes to exercising.
As I was having lunch, the phone rang.
He turned off the light.
I don't have a girlfriend.
I only wish I were able to help.
That hadn't occurred to me.
The government's investment will create many jobs.
I want to name the baby after you.
He has big problems.
Why should anyone be surprised?
I just don't understand you.
I'm all yours.
Don't push it.
I don't know anything about the future.
Arithmetic deals with numbers.
They died one after another.
Could you buy everything you needed?
My watch is broken.
What does it cost?
What for?
We depend on each other.
"I'd like to play cards." "So would I."
He told me to meet him at the restaurant.
I would like to order a sandwich.
You will find the restaurant on your right.
You can't do two things at once.
We can't do this again.
I eventually want to be fluent in German.
Bad weather prevented us from leaving.
She has no manners.
I don't even want to be here.
I'm sorry, I'm busy right now.
The situation is hopeless.
I'm more interested in spoken English.
The dog went away.
It's foolish on your part to swim when it's so cold.
I hate Mondays.
I visited my grandmother's house.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
Don't act surprised.
I'm dying of thirst.
I'm sure Tom can win.
You still haven't told me where you live.
Should I go to college?
You seem happy.
Please close the door when you leave.
He showed us some pictures.
Are you from around here?
Don't let anything else distract us.
The audience was predominantly female.
She cooked vegetable soup last night.
I need to sleep a little.
Tom and Mary are devout Catholics.
Is this your first investigation?
This is the unforgettable place where we met each other for the first time.
They're expensive.
Thank you all so much.
I have three times as much money as you.
They handled it well.
I know Tom likes to travel.
Glad to see you again.
Hold still.
That university was my first choice.
Has Tom been fired?
Do you remember the town where he was born?
Tom arrived first.
It won't happen again.
We can't see anything.
That isn't allowed.
Where did you put my keys?
They refused to think of leaving.
I did think Tom might win.
We're sneaky.
That was a pretty good move.
I sprang out of bed.
It looks like l've come at a bad time.
I ran all the way to the station.
Stop teasing your brother!
He can speak five languages.
Believe it or not, I went skydiving.
Tom broke his nose.
She told him where to put the suitcase.
The wind gradually died down.
He stared at that detailed miniature model of a dinosaur.
You're very resourceful.
Fill it with regular, please.
There were hundreds of people milling about in the streets.
Are you surprised?
Leave me.
What did the boy say?
They'll tell you the truth.
I wish I had a reason not to go.
Tom looks intrigued.
What happens next?
Summer is almost here.
It's not funny.
Why don't you have a party?
We'll never forget your kindness.
My sister is bugging me.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
He's head over heels in love.
We just did that.
I'll cook.
You're not going to like that, are you?
I miss her a lot.
Wait until your father gets home.
What is the number?
She sent me an urgent telegram.
Tom and Mary have just gotten back to Boston.
They're all safe.
Could I borrow a saw?
I'd like to know when you plan to give me back the scissors I lent you.
You're so impatient.
Drought increases the risk of fires.
He was alone in the house.
That's it. I'm outta here.
What kind of man do you think I am?
He continued working all day.
I'd like to make myself useful.
This is the perfect Mother's Day gift.
Nothing will change.
Have you seen him before?
You may choose one of them.
I've been asking myself that same question.
That company went bankrupt.
There was nothing you could have done.
I don't know why I'm in a bad mood this morning.
We went for a walk on the beach.
Tom is unable to cope with stress.
Can you stay for a while?
Step forward and make room for others.
I'll make a few calls.
He turned his back on the old tradition.
Tom and Mary mailed wedding invitations to all of their friends.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
It was obvious that they had lied.
I was away.
Who invented the telephone?
You don't seem very concerned.
He died in his bed.
We succeeded!
Tom says he didn't do it.
I asked them to fix my car.
I'll do my homework after I watch television.
Where's the light switch?
I am in your debt.
I was late for the meeting because of a traffic jam.
"Have you eaten?" "Yes, I have."
I was just kidding when I said that.
Do you have any idea where Tom went?
Tom sounds angry.
I regret that I didn't go there.
Is there a drink minimum?
Everybody in the car said they wanted to get out and stretch their legs.
Are you talking shop?
The dog follows me wherever I go.
He's the perfect man for you.
I heard her speaking English as fluently as an American.
That's not how I want things to be.
It's a lot of fun skiing in fresh snow.
The instrument panel has a very ergonomic layout.
Tom and I went to a party last night.
I suppose I could wait a little longer.
According to the TV, it will rain tomorrow.
The baby kept quiet.
I thought you should read these documents.
I don't believe that to be true.
She failed every time she tried.
I see you've made a friend.
I wanted everything.
I question your sincerity.
I caught him cheating on the exam.
It was a mess.
When did you get there?
Have you ever been on TV?
He arrived shortly after.
Instead of stopping, the rain increased.
I'm often told I don't look good in a skirt.
You're very timid.
She is sharp.
Show me a better one.
Tom didn't get a chance to thank Mary for all her help.
Cabbage can be eaten raw.
Please don't use my name.
Are you ready for the trip?
What's the problem anyway?
I never learned his real name.
He doesn't like to wait until the last moment to do something.
I should've listened to what my mother said.
Give me the car keys.
If you want to lose weight, the best thing to do is to eat properly and get a lot of exercise.
Tom emigrated to Australia.
Where are the other three?
We will become happy in the long run.
The temperature is below zero today, too.
Have you got any ideas yet?
I didn't pretend to be your friend.
No one can go in there.
Anyone over eighteen years of age counts as an adult.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
Believe that if you want to.
I go to the beach as often as I can.
His new novel is based on his own experiences.
We shouldn't ask why.
I think you're jealous.
What's the matter with you?
I don't know what's going on around here.
She put on her sweater.
Forget it.
I need to talk to you in person.
He made me a new suit.
We're fasting.
By the year 2020, the population of this city will have doubled.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
When he came to, he was tied to a chair in the basement.
Will you please go there?
I ate my sandwich.
Frankly speaking, I don't like the idea.
You're not bruised.
I won't touch a thing.
Can we get this gate open?
You don't have to come to the meeting.
The streetlight over there is broken.
I don't believe you anymore.
He found a good place for me.
He was beside himself with joy.
It is impossible for you to succeed.
I was almost hit by a car.
The cat ran up the tree.
She asked him to call her later, but he forgot to.
Please don't touch this.
Everybody was stunned.
I want to know where you heard that.
I cannot help laughing at her jokes.
Get back in the van.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
Give me some coffee if there is any left.
We should all help the homeless.
Their rude behavior makes me angry.
Where they burn books, they will eventually burn people.
I made tea last night.
We're too late.
He is in touch with all kinds of people.
Don't make me lose my patience.
What time do you go to bed?
He explained the facts at length.
I thought I'd find you here.
I don't want you to be upset.
I'm no longer groggy.
The snow was several meters deep.
He was deserted by his friends.
Please close the door.
I miss my family and my friends.
What're you doing about this?
Hitler assumed power in 1933.
I just want to let you know that I'll be late tomorrow morning.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
We have no choice but to carry on.
Nara is an old city worth visiting at least once in your life.
He needn't have come himself.
I want you to come somewhere with me.
Do you know who that guy is?
He admitted that he was wrong.
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
He gathered up his things and left.
Did you have fun last night?
He behaves like a child.
Stop playing hard to get.
These trousers need pressing.
I couldn't make him understand my English.
Don't forget your stuff.
How many people are in your crew?
How foolish of you!
Tom is very handsome.
Is everything satisfactory?
Are you tired of living?
You're my best customer.
Few people live to be one hundred years old.
How many cats do you have?
He must be aware of the danger.
They're waiting for you.
I know you're upset about your car being totaled, but you weren't injured and you should be thankful to be alive.
All the children went to bed.
We should work faster.
How's the dog?
Tom got back in the car.
I can't believe that you really sold that junk for such a high price.
Oh my God! What are you doing!?
Is that all of them?
This is the last time I'm telling you to do that.
I heard you received an award last month.
Eliminating the deficit will be a very difficult job.
We're going shopping.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
I can't believe this is happening.
The two women know each other.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Did you find a job?
What have you done with my bag?
Mary is helping her mother.
You know quite a lot about Sumo.
It is impossible for us to cross that river.
What do you call this bird?
Can you afford it?
Many cancer patients lose their hair because of chemotherapy.
She was afraid to catch a cold.
I'm not the kind to kiss and tell.
I want to go to America some day.
What time is your curfew?
He tried many different methods.
You should keep your promise.
I'd like you to postpone your trip.
I'm being promoted.
I don't have anybody else to turn to.
You can go home.
You need to go.
I gave you what you wanted.
You're lucky you didn't die.
She always expects me to help her.
I paid in advance.
I don't feel so good.
Have you put on sunscreen?
You may swim.
Get on your feet.
And now you wish perhaps to learn on less familiar traps?
I will go and take a look at the house.
Tom didn't die in vain.
I'll explain later.
Are you all right?
He found it.
Are you happy with your weight?
I know him very well.
These books belong to me.
Are you a cop?
This was Tom's idea, wasn't it?
Stay alert.
I can't believe you turned down that job.
You still haven't told me where you live.
I'm depressed.
How many times did you do that?
We cannot live without air and water.
We're getting out of here. The storm is coming.
I gave him a call.
You need to call Tom immediately.
You must have seen them there.
What time is it by your watch?
I wish you had told me the truth.
Preventive measures are much more effective than the actual treatment.
Her voice trembled with rage.
Tom got quite a few positive responses.
Do you think I look like my brother?
He regained consciousness and was able to talk.
We don't forget.
What happened to that friend of yours that you introduced me to last weekend?
A puppet does not know that it is being controlled.
I got lost in the snow.
My heart's beating so fast!
Tom isn't wearing his new coat.
I tried Buddhist meditation once, but I fell asleep halfway through the session.
I suggest you have a native speaker read over your report to make sure there are no errors.
The door was wide open.
I'll give you a hand.
If you can't explain it easily, you don't yet understand it.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
Mary doesn't usually wear jewelry.
It gets worse.
Tom arrived three days ago.
She gets up early.
There are few places to park around here.
What's there to do?
Human beings differ from other animals in that they can speak and laugh.
I don't understand what's bothering you.
There's a general sense that something should be done about unemployment.
I didn't mean to give that impression.
They struggled.
He never told anyone.
Tom didn't seem very busy.
I looked around hoping to spot a friendly face.
A fire broke out near my house.
We do not know her.
She did it on purpose.
Do Japanese people eat sushi every day?
A child is missing.
What makes you think you won't be able to do it?
We're not yet there.
Why have you delayed seeing the dentist?
I hate that book.
I know what you mean.
Our school was reduced to ashes.
You should look up that word.
Don't tell me.
Are you mentally ill?
I've seen a couple of Kurosawa's films.
These cars are ours.
I want to talk to you about this list.
Can we go?
I'm not answering that.
It was courteous of him to write a letter of thanks.
A part of this land is mine.
I'm a little disappointed.
Why did you come here?
Don't make the same mistake I did.
She lost herself in the crowd.
I don't believe that's true.
We have a witness.
I saw Tom sitting in the third row.
Did you give him up?
I don't think he is fit for the job.
I'll rip your head off!
Who punched you?
It won't take that long.
Is anyone going to eat that?
Are you free on Friday afternoon?
What would you do if you saw a man from another planet?
Pizza is the kind of food that fits into today's life style.
I'm pretty sure Tom did what he said he did.
I saw a boy crossing the street.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
She got what he said.
Why should I give you this?
My brother likes horror movies.
One man's medicine is another man's poison.
Tom screamed to Mary for help.
I'm not sure that that's true.
I'd like to ask you the same question once more.
You didn't have to leave.
I've got some things for you in my suitcase.
He had every reason for doing so.
You must study grammar more.
I think his name is Tom.
This letter says that he will arrive on Monday.
Is all this money yours?
Mother bought me a nice dress last Sunday.
We canoed downstream.
I ran upstairs.
He did the right thing.
You knew, didn't you?
The population of Shanghai is as large as that of Tokyo.
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.
They're looking for you.
Tom isn't going to wait.
I guess I should have read it more carefully.
Tom told me that he liked working with Mary.
Do you play in a band?
There is an orange on the table.
He leveled his gun at me.
Little by little, the bird made his nest.
He is a spoiled child.
Besides being a surgeon, he was a famous writer.
Get out of here before I call the cops.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
She is a good tennis player.
This bed is heavy.
I would very much like to go.
Tom cut his finger on a piece of glass.
Your plan didn't work.
I'm not convinced of that.
He has been secretly in love with her.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
How are you going to do that?
I will do it right now.
There was a cottage on the side of the hill.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
She returned the book to the library.
I won't be able to attend.
I deserve this.
Kiss me.
Could you fill me in?
What can you see?
Are you certain that's what you want?
The dishes are piling up in the sink.
Get a good start by observing carefully.
Tom brushed Mary's hair.
Don't give in to peer pressure.
Please take your time before deciding what to do.
Why are you picking a fight with me?
Just give me a little privacy.
Lunch is ready.
I'm not like that.
I can't do it alone. I need your help.
They're gone.
He turned on the radio.
Where is it? I've been searching for hours.
I owe you a dinner.
I didn't know anything.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Everyone thinks the same thing.
Tom always keeps a set of jumper cables in the trunk of his car.
Don't touch anything without asking.
These containers are airtight.
He doesn't know French at all.
He is a promising young businessman.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
Keep the dog out.
This desk is too heavy to lift.
I wonder if Tom ever took Mary up on her offer.
I think Tom didn't tell us everything.
The game would not have been called off if it hadn't rained so heavily.
I'm unlucky.
Take a seat.
Have fun.
I have many French-speaking friends.
The jets took off one after another.
Your cat is fat.
I'd like to spend less time at work and more time at home.
I was surprised by what I learned.
They love their children.
How in the world did you find me?
I know you've been waiting a long time, but could you wait just a little bit longer?
I'll get you a towel.
You're very forward.
Somebody told me that I shouldn't trust you.
Is there a rule that says I can't do this?
The only thing we could do was to bear with it.
I hate being stupid.
We met at summer camp.
Isn't that what you're here to tell us?
Did you pay for the book?
He was slightly injured in a traffic accident.
She said that she was happy.
He isn't coming, either.
No one was killed.
You've got my helmet.
This is the dress I made last week.
I will tell him about it when he comes next time.
A new oil tanker was launched.
She can swim.
Take whichever one you like.
I couldn't have solved this case without you.
Where did you find the keys?
The present time is a good time.
Did you show it to your parents?
You will be better off buying a new one than trying to fix it.
You're not bad.
They built a safe building for earthquakes.
Tom had to do it even though he didn't want to.
He attempted to climb the fence to no avail.
Can you believe this is really happening?
It doesn't get any better than this.
Playing go is my favorite pastime.
You don't get up as early as your sister, do you?
Have you worked the puzzle out?
Let's review the evidence.
My father quit drinking.
Do it when you have time.
It was yesterday that he died.
The unthinkable happened.
He lifted her in the air.
It can be improved.
Won't you come and see me this weekend?
Many foreigners speak good Japanese.
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
I don't quite know what to say.
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
Why do you laugh so hard at his jokes? They're not even funny.
He got tired of reading.
Tom is asleep in his room.
Why would I need to do that?
I don't think Tom can do that.
I'm about to go out.
While you're young, you should read a lot.
I want to be noticed.
I'm growing tired of all this arguing.
He sold all his land.
Write it down here, please.
I asked Tom not to tell Mary about that, but he did anyway.
Tom doesn't have a cat. However, Tom does have a dog, doesn't he?
I'm doing well.
I lost track of the time.
I don't like to swim in the pool.
She applied her handkerchief to his wound.
Tom knows Mary.
Are you going to a movie?
Stand up straight.
Tom is a good friend of yours, isn't he?
How is the weather today?
What kind of music do you like?
She married an American GI after the war.
Give me a little time to think it over.
Don't cheat.
It works well.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
He insisted that I join him.
I need some sugar.
Tom patted me on the back and congratulated me.
You've won!
May I eat this apple?
She has a flower in her hand.
Be more flexible.
Look, I know that.
Both of them seem suspicious.
I'm a doctor.
Are they dead?
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
I don't care why you're late.
Tom didn't look as bored as Mary.
You're big.
We're better off without you.
Would you please tell this gentleman who I am?
We walked among the trees.
I have no will power when it comes to dieting.
Come and see me once in a while.
Tom sings in a church choir.
Stop spending my money.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
You may go.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I suggest that you go by train.
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
When was the last time that you did something for the first time?
You really don't get it, do you?
All the people present were moved by his speech.
He will be missed.
I want this computer repaired.
I can't do this job without you.
This is temporary.
How do you usually decide what to eat?
We're fixing it.
We'll eat on the way.
Will you help me look for my purse?
I was really surprised.
Hey, I got you a beer.
My parents died when I was very young.
What are we doing for lunch?
I feel like going out today.
Everything I said was true.
Do you think I would really do that?
I stayed home for a week.
What do you think that means?
You're really annoying.
The water has boiled away.
I'm sure that Tom will do that.
I remember hearing this tune before.
You told us she was kind and she really is.
Rest in peace.
Will the train leave on time?
I'm studying French.
She told him all about her childhood.
Which credit cards can I use?
I really need a job.
Can my friend sleep over tonight?
Everyone kept quiet.
I saved your life.
I don't want your business.
Is this time different?
I'm bleeding badly.
I made a pot roast.
Where exactly did you go?
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
She advised him not to buy a used car.
You've been suspended.
I have no interest in putting my money into your dreams.
You don't need to say anything.
He vowed to give up smoking.
The moon is very beautiful this evening.
Driving too fast is dangerous.
If this airplane were to be hijacked, what in the world would you do?
I really like being with you.
We lived close by the sea.
I like dogs.
I had my ears checked.
The dragonfly was skimming across the water.
Please leave.
They never found out the truth.
The house is on the hill.
That is the exactly the same idea as I have.
I will act on your advice.
You speak a bit too fast for me. Could you speak a bit more slowly, please?
I will have my sister pick you up at the station.
How can I deactivate my account on this site?
I looked in the window.
I think I left something in the classroom.
Come to my room between three and four.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Birds evolved from dinosaurs.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
He has a beautiful tan.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
You disappointed me.
You could count to ten when you were two.
I had a neighbor who was blind.
Her car might be more pleasant to drive, but it also costs her more for maintenance.
Do you want in or not?
Of course you can trust me. Have I ever given you a bum steer before?
Organic food is usually more expensive.
You can't get rid of it.
Don't you feel guilty?
From the look of the sky, it may begin to snow tonight.
Tom decided to risk it all.
The addict died from a drug overdose.
That was amazing.
He is the spitting image of his father.
I told you I could help you.
They're awake.
Are they Canadian?
Either stop talking or say something worth hearing.
I appreciate that.
I just had a talk with your lawyer.
He drives roughly.
It's about time I was going.
Tom didn't get Mary's phone number.
I've been waiting for you for three hours!
The police executed a search warrant on my brother's apartment.
A person with a BMI of 25 to 29 is considered overweight.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
She didn't mind doing the dishes.
Tom says he's never owned a car.
Am I supposed to thank you?
Would you like to give it a try?
I don't see how that would be possible.
How far are you prepared to go?
They'll be so happy to have Tom back.
Sorry, I can't stay for long.
Tell the truth to Tom.
I look forward to seeing you on my next trip to your city.
No one gave up hope.
What a day!
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
Who did you visit yesterday afternoon?
Death before dishonor!
I think we've seen enough.
That book is old.
He loves taking trips.
For the time being, I must share this room with my friend.
Where did he learn this?
I fell asleep on the train.
I just can't remember.
Mary needs a dozen eggs.
I did not read a book yesterday.
We're not going to make it.
He set out for Tokyo this morning.
He runs the business with his sons.
The training was hard.
I still love you.
Mine is not so good as yours.
You're very emotional.
I saw you outside.
Do you know where the bathroom is?
Breakfast is ready.
All my friends are invited here.
My band will perform this week at Chuck's Bar and Grill. Please come and see us.
We'd better hurry then.
What's it all mean?
It's bound to happen sooner or later.
I love watching you cook.
You still have a chance.
Do you know his birthplace?
Tom loves his children, of course.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Would you like a cup of milk?
We must focus.
The meat was crawling with maggots.
Where are you all going?
I need volunteers.
I don't regret what happened last night.
I have enough money to buy it.
Do you believe in God?
I don't remember mailing the letter.
I should stop procrastinating.
Is that a picture of me?
There is not much hope.
Anyone can do it if they try.
We agreed among ourselves.
She kept working.
Where do we get the textbooks?
It wasn't mine.
I'll allow you to go.
I'm glad we didn't do that.
Tom and Mary both work full time.
Call them this evening.
Please don't hurt me.
I'm glad you could make it.
She took me by surprise.
He would be glad to hear that.
I've been trying to get a hold of you for the past two hours.
I think you're cute.
Could you tell me your mobile number please?
We have nothing to complain about.
I'm an artist.
What did I do wrong?
He was accused of theft.
You don't know the system.
They need the money.
Where ever did you buy it?
The CIA runs a thorough background check on all new employees.
I have to do it by myself.
I think you did the right thing.
The museum is open from 9 a.m.
You should try to see it.
I need to ask you for a little favor.
Tom, do you still love me?
Be kind to others.
Why did you come over here?
The typewriter is stored in the basement.
I let go of the rope.
Get me a ticket, please.
I just don't want anybody to get hurt.
You can't drive now. You've been drinking.
Shut the door tight.
It's not a beauty contest.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride in his success.
How does one become rich?
Tom is the one who broke the window yesterday.
I need a new broom. This one's shot.
We've only been together three months.
He has no fear.
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
She needed the entire afternoon to complete the work.
Tom intends to become a journalist.
I thought you were taller.
I've come to ask you a favor.
I found out something.
You should dump Tom.
We can't guarantee that.
They cut a hole in the ice and swam in the freezing water.
Please allow me to ask you a few questions.
Did he show you the picture?
We make a great team.
They lie all the time.
I must have lost it.
We will make an exception of your case.
I'll try harder.
What's the name of the company you work for?
It gave me the creeps.
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
How do you do this?
The weather is good today.
Children like gummy bears.
Do you know his older brother?
It's about time somebody did something about the high cost of medical care.
My shoes are too small. I need new ones.
You two had a fight today, didn't you?
They were better than I expected.
Tom's glad.
This pencil is yours. Mine is on the desk.
How do I do that?
I'm sorry you're leaving us.
You won't go, will you?
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
She made her point.
I've been here for a while.
I haven't seen you in ages.
I'm right behind you.
Tom never said what he was planning to do.
The President of the United States is now in Japan.
Their financial problems began in the second half of the year.
That's not a museum.
That's a good response.
Tom prefers not to talk about it.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
Two detectives followed the suspect.
I never would've believed that.
Please come into the room.
Aren't you surprised to see me?
I paid a lot of money for these.
We traveled all over the country.
I don't know what he's trying to say.
She's in the hospital now.
I'm not wearing this.
I'm such a fool.
No problem at all!
I don't really understand what just happened.
Spring fever is not a disease.
Get my rifle.
I'm already ready.
Some healthcare workers spend more time doing paperwork than taking care of patients.
That sounds very tempting.
I'm going to see Tom.
You're very upset.
I'm used to this cold weather.
We're sorry we can't help you.
What a loser!
If you wish, I'll ask.
You always want to control everything.
This was too much for Tom.
You should apologize to her for being rude.
We looked, but saw nothing.
Will you be hiring any part-time help?
These shoes don't fit my feet.
I was speechless.
How are you holding up?
We're escaping.
He's the love of my life.
Does he like me?
How is the investigation's going?
Stand up straight.
Should I ask him out?
He may have missed the train.
I'll take care of those.
I put on my trousers.
I think it's sad to not have any friends.
The farmer caught the boy stealing the apples in his orchard.
I want you to return to your seat.
Tom used to be my boyfriend.
I'm a stranger here.
My teacher told me that I should have spent more time preparing my speech.
How did you come by this painting?
They want to become rich.
No one knew who I was.
I thought I was alone.
Please go on with your dinner.
Tom was talking to Mary.
Hot lemon with honey is a good remedy for colds.
Isn't it a beautiful day?
Tom noticed Mary wasn't wearing the ring he'd given her.
May I pay with a credit card?
I couldn't let you do that.
I really am very busy.
I hate hypocrites.
I'm on a paid vacation.
Tom is a Native American.
Run as fast as you can.
That is out of the question.
Who are you?
I can't hear Tom.
Get in the boat.
You're afraid of me, aren't you?
You should have helped him with his work.
The airport is closed.
Who does he look like?
Are you still around?
Tom doesn't even know my name.
Are you doctors?
Is she your only daughter?
It takes time.
She taught him how to play the piano.
Tom has been smiling all day.
Will you help them?
It's next to impossible to finish it in a day.
No pain, no gain!
He may have told a lie.
Here is my phone number.
Are you still mad at me?
We discussed quite a few interesting things.
It's a shame that you're not coming.
I acted without thinking.
What she said made him angry.
Are you saying I smell bad?
I wonder why she is so worried.
Can we rest here a second?
I can only speak English.
She has gone shopping.
I know you want to make me happy.
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
It is going to rain this afternoon.
I don't even like you.
I feel depressed because there are a lot of things I have to do.
You should do all you can to help your neighbours.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Do you know who left that box there?
Above all, be patient.
Take care of yourselves.
Unexpected stuff happens all the time.
What was her answer to your proposal?
You're the engineer.
I like traveling by train.
There's nothing wrong with that.
I hate math most of all.
Tom isn't in bed.
I have a few tickets in row 15.
Your team is better than ours.
Sheep eat grass.
Get me all the information you can on this matter.
Let's all remember to be nice.
They unwrapped their sandwiches.
I can't pinpoint the problem.
Tom will always remember you.
Please correct the sentence.
We're in a library.
Why are you calling Tom?
Actually, we've already met.
I'm drowning.
I would like you to stay with me.
I never thought about it before.
The blonde's name is Mary.
I met my friends.
I thought I was alone.
He asked me if I knew her telephone number.
I was terrified.
Tom doesn't like to read on the train.
I don't think that's a coincidence.
He is a dreamer.
I want to talk to you about this list.
That's what really scares me.
The novel takes place in Victorian England.
Is French difficult?
He can play a flute.
You're not fit.
She threw her hands up in horror when she saw what he had done.
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for the rest of his life.
I thought we were going to win.
I had a narrow escape.
It's time for our children to go to bed.
I can fix it.
She advised him not to use too much salt, but he wouldn't listen to her.
Does Tom have a fishing license?
The mailman comes around every three days.
Tom came here to ask us to help him.
I feel sorry for her.
I despise Tom.
I don't feel like laughing.
I got carded.
You should smoke less.
I just want you to think about that.
He knows better than to believe such a thing.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
Playing tennis is fun.
Half the students were absent.
The shopkeeper went out of her way to help us.
He clearly stated that point.
I'll tell you afterwards.
I hadn't planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I have three more pages to go.
The geyser sends up a column of hot water every two hours.
Do you want a few more minutes?
You can get dressed now.
His parents loved me.
I'd like a cup of tea, please.
It is said the house is haunted.
The mountain path was under a blanket of leaves, soft and easy to walk on.
I don't know about the others, but as for me, I'm for it.
I did something I regret doing.
I believe I can trust you.
Tell Tom what Mary told you.
They are melons.
May I share your umbrella?
They worked jointly on this project.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
Why are you so hard-headed?
Draw me a sheep.
I'm in no mood to argue politics right now.
You're not tired, are you?
Is this your favorite song?
You're in pain, aren't you?
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
He has no friend to play with.
You do not have to take your umbrella with you.
Who were they talking about?
He has built up an excellent business.
I can't wait any more.
This is the house I lived in when I was young.
You seem depressed.
I know a shortcut.
Where's your mother?
I want you to beg for mercy.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
You're cuter than Mary.
I hope you're well rested.
She is preparing for college.
He confirmed that it was the wreck of the Titanic.
That would be very funny.
He is very sensitive to cold.
I didn't know.
I am being paranoid, aren't I?
I don't have a guitar.
I have better things to do.
Sorry, I've got my hands full now.
Give me a coffee, please.
We have to reduce the cost to a minimum.
When does the rainy season in Japan begin?
He finds fault with everything.
I write almost every day.
I don't have a bus ticket.
Sooner or later, his luck will run out.
Where did you learn French?
Don't let appearances fool you.
It doesn't look too hard.
Perhaps the train has been delayed.
I caught a glimpse of him from the bus.
Once you have made a promise, you should keep it.
They'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway.
Help us.
Tom used to be a private detective.
We reached the top of the mountain.
She met the man of her dreams.
Is it too far to walk?
Tom passed most of the time fishing.
I don't like the way she laughs.
This bracelet is very inexpensive.
Brush your teeth after meals.
How can you not like horses?
Tom fell down into the ravine.
After taking a bath, Tom ate dinner.
Don't put anything in the bag.
It's been unusually warm this week.
The war has not ended.
I'll get you.
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
I'm not an expert.
Tom handed Mary a cup of hot coffee.
You caught me off-guard.
I don't often get invited to parties.
Do you have any cash?
He's old and crazy.
Do you live alone?
You have only to watch what I do.
I'm going to play tennis this evening.
I can't believe we finally made it.
I feel safe with you.
How can I prove it?
I go to school with him.
He can't do that.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
Don't you have anything better to do?
How long has it been since you gave up teaching at that school?
He got across the river.
We've decided to postpone the meeting till next Monday.
He was walking ahead of the car.
How long does it take from here to Tokyo Station by car?
You know where to find me.
It's raining hard tonight.
His long absences were starting to provoke suspicion.
I remember now.
She returned his kiss.
Half of the people in the office took a day off.
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
Give us a minute.
His silence surprised me.
I get up at six almost every day.
Don't do it! It's stupid and dangerous.
I want you to know that.
We have no reason to change our plans.
How do you define normal?
I tried not to cry.
We were late because of the storm.
The two politicians met face to face for the first time.
She refused his offer.
Have you finished writing that song you've been working on?
Defend yourself.
What a funny man!
Don't touch anything without asking.
You're off the hook.
How would you like your coffee, black or with cream?
This is the end of the world as we know it.
I keep a diary every day.
What a drag!
Hold it with both hands.
Tell me what Tom took with him.
You're the teacher.
Bulgarian is like Russian.
Tom was determined to finish the job before he went home.
Time travel is possible.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
Have you gotten over your cold yet?
Do you remember what she said?
The dog was hit by a truck.
Check it out!
I guessed right.
Do you read Tom's blog?
What more do we need to make us happy?
When did you fire Tom?
He denied it.
We don't know anyone here.
We're past that.
She's had a hard life.
That's hers.
I felt powerless.
You're not very tidy.
I'll never ask you this question again.
All three were killed.
Do you really not know?
I thought you'd seen this movie.
This is no time to quibble over terminology.
That's only part of the truth.
Let me show you an example.
Tom failed to pass his driving test.
Everybody in the picture is smiling.
You must not eat too much.
They're not coming back.
Tom seldom wears his black shirt.
Drink this juice.
She gave him the brush off.
I want you to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't think it will snow this afternoon.
He's a freshman.
He hardly works.
He can read English easily.
I often study while listening to music.
This is your fault.
Can they see me?
Tom and Mary both shook their heads no.
Did you call me last night?
I hope that he will find his way easily.
You know I love you!
Give me an example.
She became very ill.
Folks, it's time I was leaving.
Hemingway enjoyed big game hunting in Africa.
They teased the new student.
I hope everything is okay.
Let me buy you another one.
That's all I can say at the moment.
Hurry home.
She did it carefully.
Whoever told you that is a liar.
I'm not done with you yet.
I've warned you before about this.
You're totally right.
We saw paramedics treating the gunshot victims.
How much did you win?
I'll give it back.
He was a weak and delicate child.
Did you encounter any problems?
I want to know who they are.
Most of my friends are guys.
I had a weird dream last night.
I'm really bad with names, but I never forget a face.
Are you willing to make a deal?
Thank you for listening to me.
How about going swimming?
We need to find somewhere to hide.
Tom's my friend.
Where do you think we came from?
He'll never achieve anything unless he works harder.
I can't say I'm terribly proud of what I did.
This is the key that opened that door.
Many people are still missing.
She is expecting a baby in June.
Don't drink the tap water.
Evil sometimes wins.
Don't talk with your mouth full.
I'm staying at a hotel for the time being.
Am I disturbing you?
Do you think it's wise to wear your uniform today?
Don't be sorry.
Did you wait for Tom?
Tom already knows you want to quit your job.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
You're not as smart as me.
I would like to visit South Korea.
I don't believe in astrology, but that doesn't mean that I don't read my horoscope.
You must work hard to succeed.
I really do hope we can still be friends.
I'll call him tonight.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
The dog barks at all strangers.
We're plastered.
I felt guilty about it.
I'll call back as soon as I can.
Are you still sleepy?
He started to study in earnest.
Winds from the sea are humid.
This just doesn't make sense.
He didn't want to talk about it further.
I wanted to go back to your village.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
I was surprised by the question.
I can't understand why Tom refused to help us.
I think we make a good team.
It is out of the question.
He has already gone home.
I finished the job yesterday.
Astronomy is by no means a new science.
I'm glad you decided to come.
Tom was sitting at his desk.
How about this one?
We're done talking.
I get nauseous whenever I fly.
I passed the examination with difficulty.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
Make a copy of this report.
Do you know how to open this box?
I didn't know you then.
The rope broke under the strain.
I've been looking forward to this.
Do you know what she said?
They say he's very rich.
I know what I like.
He assumed an aggressive attitude toward me.
Are you through with your work?
I have few books.
I was glad to hear of your success.
What was the time of death?
I want to talk to you about this report.
I have to go to work.
Life is getting hard these days.
Tom is trying to get it right.
I hope he will overlook it.
Is his story true?
Whoever comes will be welcomed.
I really like this wine a lot.
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
Tom should at least wear a tie.
The service agent helped me solve my problem.
I kid you not.
He'll be safe with me.
Don't eat the fruit in the bowl on the table. It's plastic.
Is this fake?
His salary is double what it was seven years ago.
You cannot achieve the impossible without attempting the absurd.
During hard times, people might not go on a trip, but they might be willing to pay extra for good coffee.
I'm back.
Are you finished?
You should've stayed in Boston.
The cause of the accident is not known to us.
I bought a watch.
They plan to have a party.
Keep the money in a safe place.
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
He never lies.
What're you all dressed up for?
I'm beginning to lose patience.
Doing that would be a waste of time.
He was supposed to come.
I am reading a book about animals.
She runs a dance studio.
Why didn't you just take the money?
I just wanted to play poker.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
Didn't I tell you to close the door?
I know where you keep your gun.
I am afraid of what the teacher will say.
Have you ever been abroad?
I'm now unarmed.
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
Do you really want to help?
We think that he's honest.
He put on an air of innocence.
Are you going home by bus?
Everybody believes it.
He raised his hand to stop a taxi.
Could you drive more slowly?
When I got home, I had a nice, ice-cold shower.
I don't consider this to be important.
How do you say that in French?
You can't blame her for not knowing what she hasn't been taught.
Look at that bird.
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that.
It's the only way.
Have you fixed the thermostat?
God never forgets even a small kindness.
Could you speak as slowly as possible?
Can I have a hug?
I know how busy you've been.
Will you put that thing away?
Never tell the truth when a lie will do.
You said you figured out why.
How old will you be next year?
I wasn't very athletic when I was young.
Would you like to have a look?
She displayed her talents.
Is this the only picture of her you have?
Take off your coat.
Humans only live about 70 years.
Did he say anything about it to you?
When do you plan to check out?
I have never killed nor injured anybody.
She adores him.
I even wrote a letter to Tom.
Tom wanted a divorce.
Go to school.
Have some coffee.
Tom is afraid of you.
This has never happened before.
Be fair.
"Thanks." "You're welcome."
I don't remember that at all.
I don't know exactly how to do this.
He didn't tell me everything.
The room is being painted by him.
I've already told you what I think.
I never felt this way before I met you.
All the ingredients are fresh.
The new boy had a nervous stammer.
I opened the box. It was empty.
Do you see what I mean?
Where have you been all this while?
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you.
Watch out for the sparks that are flying out of the fireplace!
I can't believe you just did that.
Tom loves you all.
Come quickly.
Leave this to me.
Did Tom ever tell you how he first met Mary?
I didn't actually want to go to college.
I really want Tom to stop doing that.
Here's my drivers license.
Japan is to the east of China.
May I ask you a favor?
Tom drank a glass of water.
We're going out to get something to eat.
I have hardly any money left.
He is fond of this kind of music.
I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
My watch keeps good time.
Can you pick it up?
I like the kind of music that Tom writes.
He taught me how to swim.
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
Mary stayed up late last night.
You're very emotional.
This is the first time I've ever written a letter in French.
Is there something wrong with your car?
It rained heavily all day long.
I just need some advice.
You killed my father.
You can't deny that.
I'm glad you see it that way.
Get down!
It's up to you.
They basked in the sun.
I did something really stupid.
They gave it to me.
He can't have told a lie.
You're cruel.
There's no reason for you to fear for your safety.
Who am I forgetting?
A is the first letter of the alphabet.
Who would buy this?
Please eat some cake.
I thought you'd want to help me.
Everyone got something for Christmas.
I've already considered that.
Tom is the youngest.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
Can I change the channel?
Show him how to do this.
I hope no one saw me dancing.
I managed to finish the work.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
I talked him into selling his house.
I don't know what I want to do with my life.
Tom couldn't sleep last night.
I want to stay with you.
Can you believe this is really happening?
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
Don't talk in a loud voice here.
Why did I trust you?
What have you come up with?
Tom called back.
Can I see that?
Don't you have a full-time job?
Let me handle it.
I think you've been very immature.
You gotta get more organized.
She spoke scarcely a word of English.
Stop staring at me like that.
They asserted that it was true.
I stepped in the mud.
We have a long trip ahead of us.
I cannot stand this noise.
Here is a list of things you should avoid eating.
It's much too cold to swim.
If you want to get elected, you're going to have to improve your public image.
They were never to return to their country.
You must make your parents happy.
My father used to read books to me at bedtime.
She married a local boy.
He should have been an actor.
The book was published in 1689.
How did you lose it?
I've just come up with a great idea.
It's getting colder and colder.
Are you going to kiss me?
I'll introduce you.
He forgot her name.
I hope everyone is happy.
He is a harsh critic.
Are you sure that's necessary?
They didn't obey their parents.
I really enjoyed last night.
We'll see each other again someday.
Tom lost three sons in the war.
Don't wait up.
How long have you been out of prison?
I don't understand why you're leaving.
How do you stop this?
She drives me crazy.
Didn't anyone question you?
I need some water.
Don't make me stay.
That's very sweet of you.
They're staring at you.
Have you told anybody?
Tom will leave the company at the end of the year.
Whose bicycle is that?
Don't you get it? This isn't about you.
Whose is this bicycle?
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
She asked him for some money to buy a new dress.
He slammed his door shut.
Do the police know about this?
You said you wanted more responsibility.
Come back soon.
It's very likely that he'll be late.
I'm terrible at chess.
She didn't want him to go overseas.
Her son was killed in the accident.
He promised to provide information.
What were you doing there?
Please come here.
Is anyone else home?
Most of the time, he doesn't get to sleep before two or even three o'clock in the morning.
What did you do with those books?
Home prices are plummeting.
It's one of the things that I like about you.
Do you wash your hands before meals?
What is your registration number?
Tom was too tired to even smile at Mary.
Nobody in the world wants war.
It is rather warm today.
Don't even say that as a joke.
How romantic!
This is a farce.
Have you already settled the bill?
Has the movie started yet?
All of my relatives are taller than me.
Refugees in Africa are seeking help.
Tom calls Mary every night.
It was fabulous.
Go back to bed.
I think we're even.
He is one of the most popular students in the class.
I think the rumor is true.
We need information.
You understand us so well.
I hope you have insurance.
Get your hands off me.
He is outgoing.
You should have your eyes examined.
He doesn't look happy to see us.
I am not always at home on Sundays.
He had barely enough money to buy bread and milk.
I studied before supper.
Does Tom know why?
He's on the dance floor.
I appreciate your restraint.
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
You should've called.
Pardon me?
She dreamed that a prince would come on a white horse to take her away.
The cost of living has gone up.
You can't just leave your car parked in front of the fire hydrant.
You're lazy.
She gets prettier day by day.
Would you mind if I borrowed this?
I like your hair.
The bill, please.
I saw a boy crossing the street.
The parents will be invited to the school celebration.
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
Would you mind letting me see your passport?
I want to know what you're doing here.
I need to be alone for a while.
You don't have to lie.
I haven't read the book you're talking about.
I'm not sure what I want to do.
You're lying, aren't you?
Everyone is not honest.
I wish we'd met earlier.
She raised an important objection to his argument.
I went to get vaccinated.
It looks like you did a pretty good job.
May I sit next to you?
They wanted to know what happened.
He is old.
I read the novel in three days.
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
When did Tom come see you?
Is today your birthday?
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
I still don't know.
I don't want to see Tom again.
Don't make me use this gun.
I want those reports on my desk within the hour.
Why are dogs easier to train than cats?
I will learn.
Since he was dressed in black, he looked like a priest.
I like your style.
I want you to go upstairs.
How do you know those guys won't try to kill us?
He promises not to drink anymore.
Even if you are busy, you should keep your promise.
She looked at me seductively.
I'll take it inside.
I want you to stay a little longer.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
I can barely pay my rent.
Actually, you're right.
Do you think I did it?
I'm glad that you understand.
His eyes betrayed his fear.
Why don't you talk to him?
My room has two windows.
You don't know them.
We made it.
He came out on top.
I want to check out now.
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
You're not a teenager yet.
I had to get something out of the car.
I came by train.
Who did you speak with?
Let's play catch.
The word "theory" is often misused.
I should head out.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom is wearing a strange-looking hat.
What can I do for you?
Oh, no! My house is on fire!
I can't wait for school to start.
He gets up as early as five every morning.
What are you good at?
Wait a minute.
She was livid when she found out all the lies he'd told her.
He accepted the job.
There were flowers all around.
I can't answer that.
I broke a bone in my foot while exercising.
Do you think this rope is strong enough?
Let's sit by the fireplace.
She didn't have a brother.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
He is now almost as tall as his father is.
I had no idea this bracelet was stolen.
I'm not uncomfortable.
Where does he work?
It was his job to gather eggs.
Why don't you go to school with us?
Add a little sugar and cream.
What is the price of this watch?
The stripes were horizontal.
Would you like me to teach you how to play chess?
When will it begin?
I suggest we take the stairs.
That's not what I think.
You shouldn't have borrowed Tom's car.
Why don't we just cancel the meeting?
He jumped from one subject to another.
It's a routine procedure.
I don't need to know this.
I've just found out who you are.
What're you doing here?
Tom knew where Mary was, but he wouldn't tell the police where she was.
He hurt his knee when he fell.
I'm not in favor of such a plan.
The paint's drying.
Why did you kiss Tom?
You're not allowed to park here.
I'm studying kabuki drama.
Don't you want everything to be perfect?
Tom saw Mary break the window.
He and I are teachers.
You dropped something.
You need to relax.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
Thank you for helping me write my resume.
I feel like celebrating.
Do you often hear from him?
Don't depend too much on others.
I didn't even think that was possible.
They declined our invitation.
Tom is not crying.
He was the only man.
I guess it's impossible for me to learn how to play the oboe.
I don't know how much money Tom and Mary spend.
Tom has lots of toys.
Who are you? What're you doing here?
Some of these young people have legs twice as long as mine.
I guess what I've said isn't all that clear, but that's the only way I can explain it.
Haven't you said too much?
I don't remember anything happening.
That never used to bother me.
I will get the work done in a week.
I heard them coming.
She was advised by him to be punctual.
You're wasting both of our time.
I don't need any help.
I want to go over these numbers with you.
How do you respond to that?
That will put you in danger.
A curtain of mist blocked our view.
I don't sleep a lot.
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama.
We're all going to die anyway.
There are too many of us to fit into one taxi.
Am I being accused of murder?
I have to apologize.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
It was his first trip as a captain.
I think it's time for me to split.
Tom asked Mary where she lived.
Give me a cup of coffee.
I think Tom was born in Boston.
I don't know what we'll do.
You need a change of air.
I am sorry.
His play was a hit.
You're free of all responsibility.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
Why are you two always fighting?
In politics there are no friends, only partners.
He's a lovely young man.
I don't know what's going on around here, but I intend to find out.
Making a model plane is interesting.
It's finally my turn.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I'll never forget going to Hawaii with her.
My dad died when I was thirteen.
He likes country music.
A bicycle will rust if you leave it in the rain.
I'm sure I saw something moving.
How many sisters does Tom have?
Now I'm used to it.
Sheep are bred for their fleece and their meat.
Tom wants to buy a car.
Are you tired of living?
We must succeed.
All his friends backed his plan.
I appreciate your suggestion.
He works like a maniac.
Tom and Mary both have very few friends.
I suddenly feel very much alone.
You have no right to interfere in other people's affairs.
Few people can buy such an expensive car.
I thought you'd seen this movie.
We've been here for a couple hours.
We're alone.
Tom, Mary and John were each given three hundred dollars.
You look very tired.
We're trapped.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
Have you finished reading that book?
They are artists.
What was it that brought you to me?
I don't have a home.
He lives with his mother.
I'm not cut out to be a politician.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
He plays the piano better than I do.
He was sentenced to death by firing squad.
I trusted my teacher.
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve.
We're on our own.
Due to the worsening weather, the departure was delayed.
Charles Moore created Forth in an attempt to increase programmer productivity without sacrificing machine efficiency.
Is that machine still usable?
I did not mean to disappoint her.
It is too cold for a picnic today.
I don't want to go with you.
Almost all the students like English.
It's really cold.
You have my sympathies.
I've never seen so many birds at one time before.
You're embarrassing me.
I'm economically independent of my parents.
I had no idea you felt that way.
He has a pleasant voice.
Tom'll call.
Tom makes things very easy for me.
It was the best party ever.
She looks young for her age.
Don't your neighbors ever complain?
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you and your boyfriend had broken up?
I went to the bank to take out money.
Can I be honest?
I don't care what people say.
Wires transmit electricity.
The chicken was great.
I'll tell you about it when I get home.
He let me go.
A young man barged in unexpectedly.
The book was better than the movie.
They say they cannot compete with low-priced foreign products.
He placed the book on the shelf.
I wanted to know what would happen.
This is your final warning.
Can you figure out this problem?
I need an assistant who speaks French.
Read as much as possible.
Any chance of us getting approved?
He quit.
Tom is a black belt in karate.
I'm still not satisfied.
This flower is the most beautiful of all flowers.
You're German, right?
Stop that now.
We tried to cheer him up.
How do I know you're not bluffing?
He strayed from his group.
I go to the movies once in a while.
I found out when we're supposed to arrive.
Everyone is waiting in the other room.
What are you talking about?
Thanks for the pizza.
A man is known by the company he keeps.
He took a picture.
I don't have anything to say to you.
Do you study French every day?
I wish Tom would hurry.
You should check your blood pressure.
We had better call the police.
Tom never said no.
He hit two birds with one stone.
We closed the restaurant three hours early yesterday.
Please be careful.
You must study more.
You weren't serious, were you?
I came here yesterday.
How much will it cost to get to the airport?
I'm going to put them in a room and let them battle it out.
I don't think Tom is colorblind.
Have you called him yet?
It is likely to be fine tomorrow.
It took more than a month to get over my cold, but I'm OK now.
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
I'm certain.
Everyone has faults.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
I see you've made a friend.
What sort of people hang out at a place like this?
She greets him every morning.
The cup has a crack.
I don't feel like partying.
He was willing to help others.
So you give up, right?
I'm a very shy person.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
I want my bicycle back.
Mary is Tom's girlfriend.
Get out if you can.
Today is my sister's birthday.
Are you absolutely sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
I left you a note.
There you are.
She lived a happy life.
I used to be fat like you.
Bring me two pieces of chalk.
It was a bold decision.
He told me about it.
I thought you and Tom were going to go to Boston.
Your sister's sleeping.
He was killed in a car accident.
She often calls him names.
Can you do a handstand?
I must go alone.
This knife was very useful to me.
We have time to sing one more song.
They don't listen to me.
He is, indeed, a man of his word.
He's getting soft in his old age.
You should spend more time studying than you do.
Everybody ran outside.
Our French teacher gives us a test every Monday.
Why on earth did you take him to the station?
He's studying.
I hate to argue with you.
I'm too old for you.
I like disco music.
I have to comb my hair.
Were you happy?
I hate fish.
Tom registered to become an organ donor.
Are all of them your friends?
We lost.
How come you're always so energetic?
They sat in a circle.
You can't have both.
My wife is a good manager.
When we got home last night, the others were already in bed and fast asleep.
Don't be such a fool.
You can sing a song.
I admire you.
She went with him to the movies.
The princess lay with her eyes closed.
What do you need exactly?
You were right, too.
It's so imprecise.
Work slowly.
He speaks Russian.
You would make a great mother.
There's nothing unusual to report.
I don't know how to operate a spinning wheel.
I am positive that he is wrong.
I am a fast swimmer.
You aren't as short as I am.
I'm feeling good.
I'm not like the rest of these guys.
The store is open.
Where did you put the television guide?
She refused to accept the money.
They have just arrived.
Tom is the one who doesn't understand.
Are you still sick?
Thanks for the drink.
Let me make plain what I mean.
I should have done this years ago.
I am afraid to go.
Why do you study?
My hobby is reading novels.
You used to love swimming.
She has many handkerchiefs.
I opened a checking account.
We heard the sound of gunshots.
I bet you'd make a great father.
What do you think Tom's shoe size is?
Do you want the job or not?
It's about time to go to school.
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
I put my coat on the table.
His essay is better than mine.
I want to see what there is inside.
I just want you to know that I won't be able to come to your picnic.
I want a full report before 2:30.
Many consider seven to be a lucky number.
I opened the window.
I ordered way too much. I don't think I can eat it all.
I don't think I could forgive myself if I did that.
Father bought me a new bicycle.
Let me have a try.
I know a lot of good restaurants.
Can I speak to the head nurse?
I just want to improve as much as I can.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
Does that mean something to you?
I cannot bring myself to do such a thing.
The airplane was flying above the clouds.
I'm sure Tom would be delighted.
They were very confused.
I'll never be able to forget Tom.
See you all tomorrow.
You made Tom cry.
I must remind you of your promise.
What's the fun in that?
Tomorrow is my birthday.
Is that mandatory?
The deadlock was inevitable.
Do you own research.
You're depressed, aren't you?
You are a genius.
I miss you already.
What's the sign over the door say?
You're fired.
You know we'd never hurt you.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
You probably don't want to talk to me.
I made reservations.
You are my hero.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
I wish there were a French translation of this book.
You said you wanted the truth.
I have fulfilled my promise.
Did you hurt yourself?
You don't have to explain.
There didn't seem to be a problem.
They never really told me.
We are the new owners.
Some people only get married to prevent their wives from marrying somebody else.
I'll do what the boss tells me.
This table isn't steady.
I didn't realize you were so good at French.
You're not missing much.
Tom and Mary have gone.
He attempted suicide.
My credit cards are maxed out.
I'm only going to say this once.
You said that you hated Tom.
How did you know that Tom's passport was in the bottom drawer?
I'm not comfortable doing this.
The storm stopped the train.
Which hat do you want to buy?
Where are the guns?
I'm a bit nervous right now.
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
Everywhere you look you can see damage caused by the earthquake.
Don't tell me to relax.
I hope that you feel better tomorrow.
This makes sense.
What did I ever do to you?
There is something about him I don't like.
Help yourself to the cake.
Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it.
You must not touch the paintings.
I want to go to town.
I don't think I was followed.
I don't work for anyone.
He made a thorough analysis of the problem.
I couldn't have prevented this.
I seldom hear from him.
Don't blame me for your mistakes.
Mother was afraid I would get dirty.
I know I should've done that.
He'll have to do this task again.
Let him in.
It's inevitable.
They make a great team.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York.
I have no idea how it works.
Do you know the capital of Belgium?
I don't like your friends.
Everybody was startled.
They were surprised by what they saw.
Do you have a nail file?
Happy New Year!
She has a cottage by the sea.
I love watching movies that make me think.
I've retired.
You may have that opportunity.
Tom never said a word to me.
I don't think this is the best time to talk to Tom.
He is a member of the committee.
I'm not so lucky.
You can go or stay, as you wish.
That was Tom's cousin.
Tom sees this in a different way.
One must do one's best in everything.
Won't you go shopping with me?
We had a blast.
I had the exact same feeling.
He helped me do my homework.
This water is a little salty.
You shouldn't be in here.
I often visited the museum when I lived in Kyoto.
This chicken is overcooked.
He stood up.
She is after a better job.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
My father tried to teach us the value of work.
I'm not scared of anybody.
She is one of my friends.
He is wearing glasses.
There is no cure for lovesickness.
Where does Tom study?
Tom doesn't want an iPad. He wants a portable device that supports Flash.
She's an honest girl.
Tom is about to fall asleep.
I fell asleep around midnight.
Don't forget to sign your name.
Are you serious?
Tom felt like the luckiest man on earth.
They live apart.
Just don't break anything.
I found a French-Hebrew dictionary at a small bookstore.
Will you show me the book?
I had a good time during the trip.
I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow.
The goods will be delivered free of charge.
I can't wait to die.
How big you are!
My house is close to a bus stop.
I'd better see what's going on.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear and she nodded.
I don't know how to handle this.
She was a charming woman.
Would you hand me that?
Why did you ditch me?
She advised him to go to the hospital, but he didn't follow her advice.
Everyone looks the same, except the one standing on his head.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Are you lonely?
After getting through customs, I was free to go wherever I wanted.
That's really great.
I don't want to live here.
I'm taking it seriously.
How do I report a theft?
Tom was apparently very convincing.
Tell Tom to stay where he is.
Did you have fun?
I just want a little more space.
Tom hardly ever wears a tie.
I'm thinking.
Do you need money?
He had his share of luck.
Don't forget your bag.
She couldn't have said that.
What are some foods you usually eat with your children?
Do you think so?
After much consideration, we accepted his offer.
I just don't understand it.
He abandoned his family and went to live in Tahiti.
I think you're not telling me something.
We meant well.
I'll use magic on him and turn him into a frog.
I persuaded him to go to the party.
We don't even know what we're fighting for.
We have to do the shopping.
I don't think I can help you.
He was surrounded by a throng of reporters.
Nobody wants to look stupid.
You weren't married for long, were you?
Don't be afraid to get your feet wet.
You can't keep talking to me like this.
Do you have a part time job?
She is muttering to herself.
How do you spend your time?
You're running out of options.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Do you feel any better?
They're leaving.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
He was re-elected mayor.
You're extroverted.
You might want to have someone look into that matter.
I think that Tom lied to me.
I'm really happy.
Don't you care?
When does it end?
It's the biggest house in the neighborhood.
I didn't really mean that.
Is that your girlfriend?
I don't ever want us to be apart.
I really don't recommend that today.
Recent advances in medicine are remarkable.
She has a rich vocabulary of English words.
He always wears dark clothes.
She still has a little money, but not much.
I hope the police catch whoever did this.
At least thirty students were absent.
A loophole in the law allowed him to escape prosecution.
We've got to conserve water.
I would like to address two questions.
Cost is a definite factor in making our decision.
I live here now.
I realize that this may sound crazy, but I think I've fallen in love with your younger sister.
I am so tired that I can hardly walk.
I don't want Mary to leave me.
The boat drifted out to sea.
I had never seen a giraffe till I visited the zoo.
The sea is calm.
Does that seem fair to you?
You're not as young as you used to be.
Father seldom comes home before eight.
He's ruthless.
I hope to see you soon.
Nature is full of mystery.
Why don't you run for president?
He's an opera lover.
Stay positive.
Tom goes there three times a week.
If you are to know a nation, you must learn its history.
Why would you want to be a teacher?
You're after me.
I have a permit for this gun.
I'm very proud of my father.
How was your meeting?
I will be glad to help you anytime.
Let's sit here for a while.
I don't like what you did to Tom.
Could you come back a little later?
I'm not completely naive.
I remember seeing this before.
I like what you did.
I hope you all learn something.
He was able to solve the problem.
The heat kept me awake all night.
I hate when this happens.
The rumor that they would get married spread at once.
Wait here.
Sugar is sweet.
I'm fasting.
When it comes to sweets, I just can't control myself.
Where will you be?
I never saw such a woman.
The rich have many friends.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
I didn't say it wasn't OK to eat.
Can you guess the price?
How do I get to Chinatown?
Where did you hide it?
I am uncertain as to whether I am the right person for the job.
Are you listening to me?
Tom says he doesn't know much about Boston.
Tom began to laugh.
Six of us are going on an excursion to the beach this weekend.
I took the little girl by the hand.
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
Tom walked out of the room.
We went to the park to take pictures.
I want to bring my family here.
You may not believe it, but it is nonetheless true.
Let's reconsider the problem.
Maybe I should be ashamed.
We make an excellent team.
I was sure I heard something.
This isn't what it looks like.
Could you draw a map for me?
It's frightening.
Do I look like I'm busy?
I wish I had known how to do it.
Unfortunately, she lives abroad.
Why don't you pull over?
Why don't you leave Tom?
He lost his way in the snow.
Tom walked to the front of the room.
I thought you wouldn't give up.
She doesn't like soccer.
Who told you the news?
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
He's too drunk.
What did you make?
Let me deal with this.
I thought I recognized you.
I think it's OK.
The boy I love doesn't love me.
How may I help you?
We went on a picnic together.
You must have thought of something.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I've done that.
Can you really predict the future?
The movie starts at ten o'clock.
I said I would help you.
The world is changing more and more quickly.
She likes Chinese food.
He made up his mind to marry her.
I don't hear barking.
He can no longer wait.
Tom tried not to cry.
You are not at all wrong.
It was the great lung-power of Caruso that made him a great singer.
Am I supposed to thank you?
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
How can you be so sure?
Tom sometimes comes to see me.
I thought you'd be grateful.
She has done her homework.
I need to talk to you now.
Can I talk to you for a second?
We have faith in you.
They went on a trip a few days ago.
I had to get away from here.
He made a cranberry sauce to accompany duck.
I participated in the discussion.
You're not allowed to eat those.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I really want to kiss you.
I've been accused of murder.
Is it comprehensive?
What do you want to say?
Do you want to be an actor in a movie?
The house has burnt down.
You knew this would happen, didn't you?
I have an idea for a movie.
Which one of you is the psychic?
One of the apples fell to the ground.
Today is a good day to die.
The weather couldn't have been better.
Gulliver's Travels was written by a famous English writer.
She danced with joy.
I hate that song.
He went to America to study American literature.
Tom didn't give me back my money.
He hammered at the window.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
I see what you did there.
Aren't you guys sleepy?
Why don't we share a room?
I'm catching on.
I'm just a normal guy.
I love to eat cakes.
I want to help you get out of this mess.
She avoided answering my questions.
What's your name?
Who forced you to do that?
The bucket is full of water.
She advised him to go to the police station.
I'm getting pretty bored with driving every morning.
She pulled the blinds down.
He'll make a good husband.
I need something to write with.
If you do your best, you're likely to succeed.
There are a lot of dustballs under the couch.
It's been a long time since I've done anything like that.
I wish I were rich.
She helped him tie his tie because he didn't know how to.
She breaks a dish every time she washes dishes.
This game is easy.
He is writing a novel.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
I have to do my best.
The pen is on the table.
At the sound of my voice, my dog pricked up his ears.
Go at once, otherwise you will be late.
The robot was so lifelike that it was creepy.
I spoke to him about it over the telephone.
I met someone the other day that I think I could fall in love with.
If you travel by Shinkansen, it doesn't seem far from Nagoya to Tokyo.
Among the five of us, she, without a doubt, speaks the most languages.
Do you know what Tom does in his free time?
I never worry.
What he's doing is against the law.
I can't pick this lock.
I haven't seen any of his films.
I'm housesitting.
That door won't open.
I wonder where he has gone.
Call off your dogs.
The two boys look more alike than I thought.
It wasn't a good experience.
Tom only has eyes for Mary.
If you need help, just ask.
I have many friends I can talk to.
You're cruel.
That company's stock price fell yesterday.
I would've told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
The boy was absent from school yesterday because he was sick.
I knew you'd enjoy the concert.
I got a temporary job at the firm.
What's the plan, Tom?
We've been warned.
Please pass me the salt and pepper.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
He is confronted by many difficulties.
I had no one to turn to.
I saw you there.
Are you already married?
You're all racists.
I know the photographer who took this picture.
The meeting took place yesterday.
Do you really think this is worth thirty dollars?
I kid you not.
Can I have a hug?
It cost me three hundred dollars to have my car repaired.
How long has it been since you played with a yo-yo?
Don't be naive.
Tom shouldn't have borrowed Mary's car.
Everything has to be perfect.
When I was a child, the most painful time of the day was mealtime.
Some voters waited hours to vote.
I can't even afford to buy a used car.
The accident happened at that intersection.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
Tom loved to do that.
I didn't read it all.
My computer won't start up anymore.
She was kind enough to show me the way.
You just screwed up.
You're not helping.
We have to memorize this poem by the next class.
I look on you as my best friend.
I had stuff to do.
Tom listens.
You're very attractive.
What do you have for breakfast?
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
The thief had special tools for picking locks.
I was assaulted.
When I grow up, I want to be a king.
Have a taste.
He aspires to become a teacher.
He has been sick since last Sunday.
Tom was arrested last year.
Why is she looking at me?
I've forgotten your address.
In Japan, bowing is common courtesy.
Please lower the window.
Can you say that again?
I've met that girl before.
You're very wise.
Are you still upset about what happened?
I have to go.
He silently went out of the room.
He does not watch TV at all.
Why are you leaving so soon?
How can you not see that?
He came by car.
That's the last thing I want to do.
May I look at your passport?
Tom had never been late for work before.
She is appearing on TV tonight.
You've put on weight, haven't you?
Don't sleep too deeply.
Tom died.
They say that Firefox is downloaded over 8 million times a day.
I've been feeling this way all day.
You can get from Washington to New York by train.
This should do the trick.
Stop being so nice.
I promise I'll mop the floor tomorrow morning.
I'm not sitting here.
I'm not skinny.
The red lines on the map represent railway lines.
How do you know what I heard?
I'm not the only one with a child.
It's time.
I knew you could do it, Tom.
We're not interested.
I need a pair of scissors to cut this paper.
They grow flowers in the garden.
I'd like to talk to the doctor alone for a moment.
You're not as beautiful as you think you are.
How are you going to solve this problem?
All of us will die sooner or later.
That's a big deal.
He works in the car industry.
What would Tom need?
What should I tell the kids now?
That's sort of nice.
Let's go in my office.
He was speaking.
I've had coffee already.
How would you translate this sentence?
Tom appeared to be in his early thirties.
What's your favorite candy?
Science will not solve all of our problems.
I have a headache and I am suffering from a cough.
This car is very expensive.
I'll walk.
The city supplied the needy with blankets.
Because I live near the school, I come home for lunch.
I think it makes sense.
Have they spotted you?
We'll all die sooner or later.
I had a really great time with your family.
Tom had never seen such a beautiful garden before.
He didn't want to sell the book.
I like being my own boss.
Follow me. I'll show you how to get out of here.
If you behave like a flunkey, you're treated like a flunkey.
It goes without saying that it was supremely difficult to carry out this mission.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
Tom was alive.
I forgot to turn off the gas!
My hobby is collecting stamps.
Are you sure you're not tired?
It was superb.
I never should've left you.
He's done this before.
The woman is reading.
I'd never met Tom before this morning.
You broke the rule.
She told him to study.
I would like to express my gratitude to her.
He never takes any notice of what his father says.
When we started out in this business, many people said that we would fail.
Do you want me to be happy?
I also went there.
I just gave blood.
It is necessary for you to stop smoking.
Day in and day out, he does nothing but tend his sheep.
If Tom had been wearing his seat belt, he wouldn't have been injured so badly.
Which woman is your aunt?
I made fun of him.
Let's talk about this again tomorrow.
Tom doesn't know who Mary has decided to give her old guitar to.
I need your cooperation.
Hold it!
Are you trying to tell me something?
Which student went out?
You're not being rational.
That doesn't make any sense to me.
I write in my diary every day.
My brother took me to the museum.
If you are free tomorrow, I can show you around Kyoto.
Tom claimed to be an expert in finance.
That's all I ever wanted.
Business expenses are tax-deductible.
It all happened quickly.
"I would love to go to the dance with you." "Really? You would?"
That's a real long shot.
I think we should call the police.
I believe congratulations are in order.
Did I miss much?
This is a DVD.
We won't go back to Boston.
We have more to do.
Have you ever been to an opera?
I've got to speak to you.
I can't promise anything.
He leaned against the wall.
He was meditating on his future life.
The coffeepot is boiling.
Who was the man you were talking to?
Did the police arrest Tom?
She talked him into buying her a diamond ring.
He's a bit jealous.
It's really different from what I expected.
Boxing is boring.
Can I go first?
I'd like to do that.
He died of old age two years ago.
Tom usually has a glass of wine before dinner to whet his appetite.
I'm waiting for lunch.
He was happily married.
What did you just say?
What time does it open?
He's very skeptical.
Stop putting off finding a job.
You'd better come see this.
I didn't move.
Why don't you sit right there on the couch?
I want to have a proper house and garden.
It's a scalp disease.
Could you get it for me now?
He went to see her the other day.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
If someone who doesn't know your background says that you sound like a native speaker, it means they probably noticed something about your speaking that made them realize you weren't a native speaker. In other words, you don't really sound like a native speaker.
You need to be more patient.
Whose computer is this?
I've been waiting for you since two o'clock.
Tom disguised himself as a fireman.
The leaves on trees have turned red.
I was born on the 31st of May in 1940.
You don't have to respond.
She's as busy as Tom.
You can't rely on his help.
This isn't the time to talk about that.
Can you think of any reason why that might be the case?
Does Tom have to be present?
I'm stunned.
This is Japan.
I'm not able to speak so fast.
I am looking forward to Christmas.
He became a famous actor.

Tom wasn't there yesterday.
She found a need and she filled it.
I want them to be your friends.
This place is perfect.
I found him lying on the bed.
You can't have that.
Show me another watch.
We have a new coach and some new players.
Might I express my opinion?
Everybody had a good year.
Tom said he was very happy.
I tried explaining the algebra homework to him, but it just went in one ear and out the other.
You're never too old to learn.
We're still not sure.
I think you look really great.
When did you come?
He's very fond of walking.
I'm proud of my children.
I really want you to hug me.
I'm working on my website.
How much did it cost us?
Some people like red wine and some people like white wine.
You said you wouldn't talk to Tom.
You're not supposed to have this key.
There are various ways to get to her house.
You should face up to the reality.
Have you been told the reasons why we didn't hire you?
I'm glad to see you.
I never stop thinking about you.
Tom is very good-looking.
Is she at home?
I've seen this before.
They probably don't know.
He has a good memory.
This steak is as tough as shoe leather.
Everyone seems to agree.
You're overqualified for this job.
Blow your nose.
Bring your children along.
I don't have a boyfriend.
I will not do it again.
You were there, too.
Are you sure they can do this?
It's a luxury we can't afford.
As far as I am concerned, I have nothing to say.
There are a lot of bridges in this city.
I love you both.
It's too good to be true.
Would you like to play with us?
Please don't distract me from my work.
That's true, too.
You might as well go kill yourself.
Tom speaks French better than his classmates.
This showy dress isn't appropriate for me.
We won.
Tom finished washing the dishes.
This is the first time I've written a letter in German.
They did what they were told.
I realized what was happening.
Cats are smarter than you think.
Don't tell Father about this.
My house has two bedrooms.
You're fascinating.
You're Canadian, right?
It may well be that you're right.
Are we in the same hotel?
I'm willing to accept your offer.
The job is almost done.
I don't have the results.
Do you want me to walk you home?
This railing is not as stable as it could be.
Do you speak Latin?
I have to know now.
I'd say you did well.
My little brother is watching TV.
I'm bored right now.
He can also speak Russian.
I'm glad you're all right again.
Don't worry about your family.
She was kissed by him.
Do you like dogs?
What's your shoe size?
Are you looking at me?
He saw everything.
She introduced me to her father.

He worked harder than ever.

He went to stay with his cousin.
He's likely to be chosen.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
That was unforgivable.
Tom walked into the courtroom.
I had a terrible experience.
A contagious disease descended on the town.
I've figured out the puzzle.
I want to see you in my office this afternoon.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
Tom's name is on the envelope.
He's always breaking into our conversation.
Tom swims very fast.
We're old friends.
I can't do it alone. I need your help.
We will begin the party when he comes.
I have questions.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
The American ships were stopped and searched in British waters.
We have to keep working on that.
I need to take care of my kids.
Tom had a difficult job.
What's your favorite board game?
I am sure that he will become a great singer.
I think you did very well.
I'm looking for an easy-to-read manga with furigana.
Do you know what that means?
I miss you when you're not here.
There are no clean plates.
He can swim.
It's too far away.
I thought you'd be older.
We're all impressed.
He was never to see his native land again.
Show it to her.
See you soon!
You should have kept your mouth shut.
He climbed the tree without difficulty.
It's a girl thing.
I will go with you if necessary.
I really hope so.
Where can one buy books?
Don't they drive you mad?
Elves have pointy ears.
Would you mind if I borrowed this?
She spends a pretty good chunk of time just sitting there and looking out the window.
Which museum would you like to visit first?
I suppose you'll be needing this.
I was grateful.
It always happens this way.
I'm not ashamed.
She was stupid enough to go out with him.
You must be out of your mind.
It smells bad.
Aren't you sick of eating fast food?
They did not feel like playing any more.
Stop complaining about the weather.
My children were born in Boston.
All the stones have been moved.
We need more people like Tom.
I can't tell you what you want to hear.
I remember that feeling.
It would be better to stay home today.
I really liked that.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I ate apples.
They were not listening to music.
Happy is a man who is contented.
I can't help feeling something's not quite right.
Wash your hands well.
This is where he lives.
I came for you.
Folks, it's time I was leaving.
Don't count on them.
She came here as soon as she heard it.
It's a strange one.
I must make an apology to her.
We haven't seen it yet.
There are lots of animals in the park.
It's been a pleasure chatting with you.
Any amount of money will be welcome.
The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
Why are you guys so angry?
He was absolved of all responsibility.
I worked with Tom.
Where did you go for spring break?
I wonder if this is love.
Could I get one more beer, please?
Don't drop that cup.
I'll be there Monday night.
I haven't read any of his letters.
I don't blame them for this.
No matter how he tried, he could not open the door.
I think maybe you've made a mistake.
I like your beard.
He failed in his attempt to swim across the river.
I hope you won't expect results immediately.
It's ideal weather for a picnic.
Which wine goes best with red meat?
He told me that you were right.
Don't be such a fool.
I still don't get it.
Why do you have to do it?
Almost no one believed him.
He drinks like a fish.
A one-way ticket to Birmingham, please.
It is not necessary to bring a gift.
She liked that.
I think the box has something in it.
I can teach you how to drive.
How long have you been busy?
Is he really the man you're looking for?
He was elected president.
I saw him play baseball.
You're a good journalist.
Tom is a skilled player.
The students are sitting in a circle.
Do your best!
When does the plane leave?
I have to go home.
In 1994, there was a shortage of water and rice in Japan.
My wife is a good manager.
There's no entertainment for young people around here.
Tell Tom to shut up.
I know you feel bad.
Tom used to be a heavy smoker.
I am baking bread.
It rained continuously for three days.
Don't breathe a word of what I've told you to anyone.
Don't you understand what's going on here?
I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble.
I'll treat you.
Do you plan to buy that car?
We'll miss you.
You have provided me with some very useful advice.
Have you heard the latest rumors?
It almost worked.
I have no idea what you mean.
Of course I will go.
I don't know what that is.
What are you so scared of?
Don't you want some ice cream?
My mother feels better.
Many architectural monstrosities are seen in Tokyo.
You shouldn't be impatient with children.

In addition to being a famous physicist, he is a great novelist.
Please help yourself to the cookies.
We're very satisfied with it.
I failed the exam because I didn't study.
What're you drinking?
Who would you like to speak to?
What is your idea of a good time?
I can remember when you were just a little boy.
Everyone ate the same thing.
What is your age?
I didn't mean to pry.
The workers are on strike.
We decorated the room ourselves.
He finished his dinner because he didn't like to waste food.
He is having lunch now.
I felt very uneasy.
They must have had an accident.
I've been looking for it all morning.
This watch is better than that one.
It was boring.
I appreciate all your advice.
Is that what you really want to do?
I've been waiting for hours.
When will you stop scheming?
Don't you think it's strange that he's not here?
You shouldn't be impatient with children.
He saw the girl.
Tom showed her the letter from Santa Claus.
I suppose you are right.
This is all I can do for you.
This is awesome.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
The problem is that solar energy just costs too much.
Are you alone?
Would you do it?
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
Do you know how to get to our place?
I didn't really believe it.
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.
We have no comment.
Tell Tom you can't do it.
Tom has never lived anywhere other than Boston.
You're overreacting.
When did you start writing songs?
Have you bought your Christmas gifts yet?
Has Tom always been fat?
Get me something to eat.
Can I tell you something about women?
I can't see anything from here.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
He was found lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
I forgot to tell you something.
She moved my clothes.
I agree with you absolutely.
Now she understands what I mean.
They started working right away.
I kind of like you.
It is hard to adapt this story for children.
Everyone else waited.
Does this make me look fat?
Can we really learn to speak a foreign language like a native?
I don't wish to anger you.
This is irrelevant.
Stop being so nice to me.
Tom has been to Australia three times.
What did you do with my luggage?
I parked on the street in front of your house.
It's your choice.
One wonders how it's possible.
If you really don't want to come, you don't have to.
I always arrive a little ahead of time.
I can't make promises.
I need a car.
You need to be here for your family.
I have a rough idea where it is.
I'm only three years older than he is.
Be discreet.
I do not want any money.
They were punished for their crimes.
What Tom did was incredible.
You'll go to school tomorrow.
I told him to come visit us.
I wasn't sure I could do it.
My feet stink.
He's a senior.
She is about my age.
Tom told me I shouldn't swim there.
The sky grew darker and darker.
Each of them sang a song.
I caught a fish!
Don't drink any alcohol.
There are no dogs bigger than this one.
I've made a decision.
If I were you, I'd study harder.
Why didn't you run?
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
Come right in.
What time will you have breakfast?
He blew out the candles on the cake.
He hit me on the head.
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were, but that's not going to happen.
How do you not understand?
I really wish I could be there with you.
That's a relief.
I'm better-looking than Tom.
You're either with me or you're against me.
I still have a lot of questions I want to ask you.
Strictly speaking, the earth is not round.
I don't like talking with Tom.
I was really apathetic at first.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Did you pay somebody to write this for you?
Are you still recovering from last night?
Don't just whine, do something!
I'm busy preparing for the trip.
I advise you never to live beyond your income.
Do you have a violin?
I remember that guy.
I like to watch TV.
Call me.
She tried in vain to please him.
We are eleven in all.
I didn't even think that was possible.
You'd better sit here.
Bring me a glass of water, please.
I'm rested.
She may be our teacher.
He is a sort of painter.
They said yes.
She is endowed with a special talent.
A lot of people are now trying to sell their houses.
He did it again.
Lie still.
It isn't something I want to do.
I left my textbooks somewhere.
Do you think I'm too materialistic?
Tom is a journalist in Boston.
I caught a carp in a net.
The road turns left there.
You gotta get more organized.
He doesn't drink coffee.
He was getting old.
I want to sleep in my own bed tonight.
This is a support group for widows.
So, how does it feel to be a father?
We'll never forget your kindness.
I shouldn't have invited Tom to my party.
I sometimes take a shower in the morning.
I felt left out.
He whittled the stick to a sharp point with his hunting knife.
I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope.
They're very fond of him.
I need to know everything that you know about Tom.
That's not fair.
Everything has changed.
Do you know when she will come?
That goes without saying.
He stole a glance at the girl.
Are you sure that's safe?
I hope to see you again.
Don't rely on others.
My wife is very upset.
You had a good weekend, didn't you?
What do you need?
She continued with the work.
Clearly you are mistaken.
He has many tenants on his land.
You're a wonderful guy.
I don't have to apologize for what I said.
I don't go out much.
He meets his girlfriend on Saturdays.
I prefer biking.
Tom's arm brushed against mine.
You never know what you can do till you try.
Liars must have a good memory.
Will you please put the baby to bed?
Tom never liked school.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
That is my own affair.
What's your favorite free software application?
Is he aware of the difficulty?
I don't even want you there.
Should we intervene?
This shop has more candy than that shop.
He's really quick.
She is always neatly dressed.
I'm glad you weren't here.
We're newlyweds.
I'm used to this cold weather.
The store closed down for good.
She always fed her children before she fed her dog.
I hear that he sold his house.
I didn't run away from home.
You're not alone.
He has been gaining weight.
Did you tell Tom what he needed to know?
A gentle wind is blowing.
Shake before using.
Do you know Tom's wife's name?
They're both beautiful.
Tom opened his beer and took a sip.
We climbed higher so that we might get a better view.
What's your job?
We're volunteering.
That he loved her was certain.
We are a family.
I usually get up at eight o'clock.
You are so cute.
I saw her play the piano.
The bigger boys torment the little ones.
I'm getting tired of this.
Tom went to high school with me.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
You're not as good as you think you are.
What do you do for fun?
The rainy season begins towards the end of June.
Once she starts talking, she is hard to stop.
She did her best to persuade him.
The boys swam in the river.
She advised him to take the medicine.
She doesn't know what she really wants.
Management hid the true financial state of the company from the workers.
Tom's funeral will be this weekend.
We're redoubling our efforts.
She made him cry.
I'll sue you.
Tom's house is very big.
Are you ready now?
I felt very relieved when I heard the news.
Did you have a good weekend?
The restaurant was quiet.
I'll call Tom and apologize.
He held on to my hand tightly.
This is very dangerous.
I am only too glad to help you with your work.
It's about time.
I was stupid enough to believe it.
I've just seen the results.
I have business elsewhere.
I'm very excited and happy.
It's a strange one.
The job offer still stands.
I opened a bottle of red wine.
We have a lot of English books in the library.
The tenor sang very well tonight.
I can't believe you said that.
I have a sweet tooth.
Tom doesn't need me.
How many of you are going?
The slaughter of the prisoners was a barbarous act.
You look perfect.
Follow Tom.
I want to show you something in the office.
Stop acting like a child.
I screwed up the very first note.
The city was blanketed with snow.
Get a doctor.
I'll win using whatever means it takes.
This box is very heavy, so I can't carry it.
I trust we understand each other.
Grab that.
I'm not a morning person.
I think Tom did this.
You've told me that joke before.
I've had a good day so far.
Tom knows.
I was just going to work.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
Who's working tonight?
I had no friends except for Tom.
Promise me one more thing.
I'll have them repair my car.
I'll be with you in a sec.
How many pens does she have?
It's not just illegal, it's also dangerous.
What did you call me?
I've decided to give everyone a raise.
Don't forget to ask follow-up questions.
These houses were burnt down to the ground by the enemy.
It's a bad habit.
Tom dyed his hair black.
They will survive.
Your ideas are weird.
He seems happy.
I'm glad.
I washed it.
You are a bit fat.
I am interested in taking pictures.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
This is my CD.
I love your daughter.
These are my shoes and those are yours.
My father was an engineer.
Can you guess where I am right now?
I made him change his plan.
Was it difficult to make?
Neither of these is mine.
Tom doesn't understand me.
He appeared thinner every day.
He was wearing a threadbare suit.
Those dogs are big.
Do you want to give it another try?
"May I park here?" "No, you can't."
I had some things to do before the meeting.
She was stupid enough to believe him.
Can you imagine what life will be like for them now?
Let's see if they let you talk.
You're nice.
We often have barbecue parties in our backyard.
Where did you find the key?
Don't let opportunities pass by.
Don't interrupt me! Can't you see I am talking?
You're through.
I was quite nervous.
I am undressing.
I don't have to do anything right now.
When did they build that?
When will you come back home?
No one would offer him a job.
He's shy, and never speaks unless spoken to. You have to talk to him.
Each of us has to be careful when driving.
I'm sure that he'll come on time.
Who gave you this?
What's wrong with you tonight?
I met him in January.
These shoes are a little loose.
I'm done.
Cut that out!
I don't have time to argue with you.
We're all sure of that.
My investments earn about 10 percent a year.
Tom didn't get home till midnight.
It was understandable.
That's ridiculous!
Is this Tom's bike?
Forgive us.
Tom waited a while.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
I decided not to go.
Is his father a doctor?
If he's proficient in English, I'll hire him.
I can't finish the job in so short a time.
I took the cake out of the oven.
Don't look so shocked.
You've got to be making this up.
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
You're outgoing.
The prize will go to the best student.
They feared you.
You gotta get more organized.
They slept in the same bed.
Everyone started arguing.
I want to be pampered.
Let's get together tomorrow.
I'm sure I've met that man somewhere, but I don't remember who he is.
Someone coughed.
They obeyed.
He can help you out.
Most of the plants died.
I was going to visit a friend.
They trusted you.
It is impossible for him to do it.
Do you think anyone can see me?
French bread is delicious.
Personal liberty is diminishing nowadays.
She has to look after her mother.
I think I'm done.
Everybody in the village looks up to him.
May I have the key?
It is threatening to rain.
Are you angry?
Don't open your books.
I've never flown in an airplane.
They were naive.
They have been busy.
I love what I do.
This is silly.
You were hurt, weren't you?
They don't know us.
He is sure to succeed.
I'm not against people owning guns.
Tom has a big TV.
They're students.
This bicycle is mine.
Who's that?
I knew there would be something to eat.
This is not funny.
I live in this house by myself.
Let's hit the town tonight and have some fun.
When did you plant these trees?
She looked up at him.
Where are we going next?
We must hurry.
I eat a lot.
I appreciate that very much.
Some animals are active at night.
She makes him do his homework before dinner.
We worked together.
You don't understand the procedure.
Many sects have initiation rituals for new members.
Tom promised to be here before 2:30.
Everyone screamed.
I think you're jealous.
Who's ready to order?
Tom felt someone touch his arm.
She looked him straight in the eyes.
Her silence surprised me.
Whose room is this?
We can't see it.
Take a bite.
Did anyone see you there?
Is there a cat under the table?
You need to wash your hands.
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I don't understand this obsession of yours.
The earth is similar to an orange in shape.
This shouldn't be happening.
This is my family.
She was kind enough to help me.
What are you doing to stop this?
Don't even say that as a joke.
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow.
A true scientist wouldn't think like that.
We all agreed with Tom.
I want you to be prepared.
I did this for my son.
Let's just drop the subject, OK?
How was your flight?
I'm not scared to die.
I'm pleased with his performance.
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
We need to conserve ammunition.
I can swim as well as you.
I added his name to the list.
You're kind.
This box is light.
Let's see if I've got that right.
I'm dripping with sweat.
He bicyled to the beach every weekend.
I feel giddy.
I'm so tired that I can't study.
One lump of sugar, please.
I just want to thank you.
Aren't you going to report it?
You don't want to be an editor?
I love strawberries on Christmas cake.
Why do you always want to do things the hard way?
You can do it if you try.
When did that happen?
Tom came into the room without knocking on the door.
Let's be honest. That joke was about me.
He asked me to do it.
Preheat the oven to 130 degrees.
They all died.
I just want to die.
I forgot to write the address on the envelope.
The soldiers filled the sandbags with sand.
I did the job in three days.
I'd be delighted if you could join us for dinner.
Keep your hands up.
If you don't leave, I'm calling the cops.
I find you irresistible.
I appreciate how you feel.
Have you been told where to park your car?
You've risked enough.
Come get it.
In case of fire, break this window.
Did you see my camera?
You need to take a cold shower.
I saw the boy in brown shoes.
I got dealt a bad hand.
That's why I called you.
Today is tomorrow's yesterday.
Who are these men?
I'll keep your advice in mind.
I don't go to school by bus.
I know Tom is careless.
Luckily, we have a plan.
I hate dogs.
He told me the story of his life.
This coffee tastes great.
That's rather amusing.
You're my kid's teacher.
Are you ready to party?
I'm glad I hired you.
Old people deserve respect.
He is less impatient than his father.
What can Tom do?
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
How can we prove that?
I couldn't tell you why.
She asked him for help.
I didn't say I liked it.
He gave us the signal to begin.
My dad taught me how to do it.
I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn.
They live in deplorable conditions.
Are you mentally ill?
For me, this is not a problem.
I really like being with you.
The more you study, the more you know.
There is no answer to your question.
Tom showed Mary how to boil water in a paper cup.
This bread is hard as a rock.
She has three children.
Don't make fun of me.
How did Tom pay the rent?
Some people still believe that the world is flat.
Do I annoy you?
I haven't even unpacked my stuff.
Tom has apparently studied French.
No matter what happens, just keep smiling.
Would you please fill out this form?
I didn't expect that to come from you.
My house is only a mile from here.
Don't forget to see me tomorrow morning.
You all did good work.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
How are things at school?
What color are your wife's eyes?
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
Her speech moved the audience.
You haven't eaten, have you?
I'm looking for my mobile phone.
I've never seen anything like it.
I just got here last week.
Here is your dog.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
I saw a cottage in the distance.
I am out of time.
Thousands of people were deceived by the advertisement.
I could not stop laughing.
My father's in the garden.
Help me if you can.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I had an asthma attack.
I was profoundly disturbed by this news.
Nobody likes that guy.
Tom can't help you.
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be the boss.
The artistic beauty of the garden is truly amazing.
I don't expect you to forgive me.
Is it true that you were on TV yesterday?
The bad weather's preventing me from leaving.
She seems to be involved in that murder case.
I'll get there before you.
There's a park near my house.
My father gave me a watch for my birthday.
There's only one way to find out how to do that. Ask Tom.
You've always been that way.
I told him to be quiet.
We had a lunch date, didn't we?
I'll give you five dollars.
His car spun out of control going around the curve.
"Do you know when they will arrive?" "At eleven-thirty this evening."
Tom led the attack.
We traveled around the world last year.
Am I under suspicion?
I'll tell you my story.
I had my hair cut at a barber's shop.
Do you like this music?
Tom retires next spring.
He learned how to swim.
He always keeps his promises.
I hate losing.
We'll give you your revenge.
Can I give you a ride?
All three of us are students.
He's such a great guy.
Be ruthless.
Tom stopped Mary.
Are they tall?
She had gone to bed.
I'm here to stop you from making the biggest mistake of your life.
This is the dictionary I use every day.
Thanks for your contribution.
What are you planning to do after this is over?
I'd like to play tennis with you some day.
I'm not sure anything happened.
At last he attained his goal.
I'm going to the station.
All my plants died.
I will be working on my report all day tomorrow.
This movie is politically incorrect.
I think you're ready.
That's not love.
I mean no harm.
That makes me happy.
He threw the letter into the fire.
I'll obey.
Someone took my place.
I will definitely attend your funeral.
I know that this is important to you.
Tom spoke in French at the meeting.
Tom is Mary's stepfather.
Japan imports a large quantity of oil.
That's what I told them.
He is very good-looking.
I have to see it all.
What's your favorite toothpaste?
I know what the three of you want.
It was just the beginning.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
The dog's collar is red.
I like watching people.
He has a dog and six cats.
You're not supposed to be smoking in here.
I don't trust him any longer.
We kept together for safety.
I've never seen such a large whale.
I lost my passport. I'll have to get a new one.
She used to love him.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
This pizza is really good.
Why do you want that anyway?
Tom died at 65.
I want to visit Cuba before Castro dies.
I want to know how this happened and why.
We were very careful.
Aren't you embarrassed?
Why are your eyes so big?
Stop putting off finding a job.
This is the first time that I've eaten in an Italian pizzeria.
Tom still uses a typewriter.
I got upset.
Tom won't let anyone touch it.
I said he could go.
I saw her again.
That's not the only reason.
Tears rolled down his cheeks.
I thought he was my brother.
I've always loved you.
I haven't had dinner.
I can play the piano.
I trust him completely.
Can we say no to the USA?
You're three years younger than Tom.
Tom lied to you, didn't he?
Let me say a few words by way of apology.
In a town with only one barber, who shaves the barber?
I thought you'd want to try some Japanese food.
He's waiting for you at home.
This is the end of the world as we know it.
I read a lot of magazines.
What happened last night?
It is not easy to learn a foreign language.
It looks like we have company.
I can't walk because of my broken leg.
I fell asleep on the train.
I'd like a receipt, please.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Not everyone can be a poet.
I can't believe you're getting married.
A fish swims by moving its tail.
He heard the sound.
I can't make it to your party next weekend.
It is not so difficult as you think.
The little girl, deeply moved by the old man's pitiful story, burst into tears.
Last night someone broke into the small shop near my house.
I forgot that today was Saturday.
Luckily, I won first prize.
We're friends, right?
Let's see you talk your way out of this one.
I was playing a game when I felt an earthquake.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow.
You're a funny guy.
I was in the hospital a few days ago.
The noise kept me awake all night.
He didn't say a word.
You shouldn't prejudge people.
I felt comfortable.
Are there any English magazines in this library?
I'll stay with Tom until you return.
Don't do anything you might regret.
She showed up early for practice.
Do you really want to go there?
It is not going to rain this evening.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
I don't approve of the way he bullies others.
Are you joking?
I think I'll go to Boston next weekend.
I have your diary.
I want to live in Tampa.
The forensic technician found gunshot residue on the victim's hand.
Catch you later.
You are a good person.
I knew the risk.
If you have something to say, say it now or pipe down.
Please wait until we get the results of the examination.
How was your summer?
I don't really know what this means.
Tom writes slowly.
You all right?
Why are you alone?
We didn't want to go, but we had to.
I guess I'm spoiled.
Now that you're my girlfriend, I'm happy.
Unfortunately, she didn't come.
Don't look at us.
You have a lovely daughter.
I don't know where my keys are.
I was quite shocked by this.
Yesterday was a good day.
Toward midnight, I fell asleep.
Please take my advice.
I just wanted to be popular.
That changes nothing.
Take the wheel.
I want to talk to you after class.
They're carnations.
Why would anyone want to swim in this river?
Father manages the store.
He was panting.
You can pick up a lot of words by reading.
I only came to say I'm sorry.
She came to see me the other day.
It looks like we might have good weather today.
He does not care for any sport involving team work or quick responses to other players.
She cursed him for forgetting his promise.
The result remains to be seen.
Do you like my new haircut?
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
Did you take a bath?
I have two cameras.
This book is worth reading.
It was bad enough that he usually came to work late, but coming in drunk was the last straw, and I'm going to have to let him go.
I was able to play piano very well.
Do you want to be a bartender all your life?
I found the subject fascinating.
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
He wouldn't even speak to me.
Do you remember your grandfather?
There was another one.
We're both fine.
I'm getting tired of your complaints.
I've already told Tom what to do.
I want to have a word with you.
Is it money you need?
I think you ought to pay more attention in class.
I got a useful piece of information out of him.
Those are nice.
He's very influential in the world of medicine.
I'm glad that the rain has stopped.
The child threw a stone at the dog.
I've got to get back to work.
Let me see that list.
Did I forget to mention that?
Tom walks.
She could not get over her husband's death.
My mother made a sweater for me.
This handle will not turn.
This work is simple enough for a child to do.
I can't blame you.
She made him clean his room.
Tom wants Mary to keep him company.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
Put your pajamas on and go to bed.
I have a lot to do this morning.
It was not until recently that she changed her mind.
How is your weekend going so far?
Can you climb up that tree?
Are there any tours of the city?
Tom didn't want this to happen.
We can do a lot better.
I was very flattered.
That's his.
Tell me the truth.
Are you nervous?
He dreamed about his home.
A good idea occurred to him.
This bicycle belongs to me.
I'm sorry, I left my homework at home.
I played an interesting game of chess against the computer last week.
He resigned.
I'll leave Boston tonight.
Can you tell me what Tom said?
Tom pays his taxes.
I could've married Tom.
I know Tom better than I know you.
That's not something to joke about.
You can use my desk if you want to.
We'll all be dead eventually.
We're always here.
Just pull the door shut. It'll lock by itself.
He began with a joke.
What you say makes no sense.
I got up at 4:00, ate some food, then went back to sleep.
Do you know what day it is today?
This song reminds me of my junior high school days.
They have had no rain in Africa for more than a month.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
She came back soon after five o'clock.
I never saw Tom before today.
I answered the question.
My doctor told me to give up smoking.
I remember seeing him.
You don't really expect me to tell you, do you?
I know your problem.
She hugged him.
What did Tom do today?
I am no longer young, but I can still bite.
What are your qualification?
You are taller than me.
My job will only last two years at most.
I want you to come and get me.
I heard her sing a song.
Good afternoon. You are our new neighbor, if I'm not mistaken?
Today is election day in Poland.
Do you know the family?
Tom isn't welcome in my house anymore.
You're all right.
My father works in a factory.
You're cruel.
That should be enough for now.
French has many more vowels than Japanese.
I'm aware of that possibility.
He is good at cooking.
Tom has a picture he wants to show Mary.
It was a mistake.
The game has been postponed.
I don't have a gun.
Lincoln died in 1865.
We only want you.
I can't lend you this book.
Did I really say that?
Don't be afraid of seeing the doctor.
What was the weather report?
Tom, your life's in danger.
I guess you're right.
You'll have to ask someone else.
What did you just write in your notebook?
Tickets are available to the public for $30.
Let me handle it.
My wife works in a nearby pub.
Give me back my pencil.
I'll be perfectly all right.
I want to buy a new bicycle.
Do you think that money really matters to me?
He's been waiting here for a long time.
They're doing it right.
In Japan, we still sometimes see someone use an abacus, but not as often as we used to.
I persuaded him that he was wrong.
Tom said he found something strange.
You could've ruined everything.
Do you like Moscow?
I am going to Osaka station.
My family are all well.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
You should get married again.
I did the same thing in Boston.
I'm lucky to have a job.
I think I agree.
I just don't want anybody to get hurt.
I left as soon as I could.
Let me know when you get the package.
Take care of it.
She answered my letter right away.
She lost a book.
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours.
It's getting larger.
I'm more than happy.
This textbook is written in simple English.
Tom cut down the tree with his chainsaw.
Trim the fat off the meat.
I decided to come to Japan last year.
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?
He told me everything.
See things as they are.
When summer is over, the days grow shorter and shorter.
The campers were hard up for water because their well had run dry.
I'm the spokesperson for this organization.
I've given up on the idea of buying a house.
We want you to take it.
She told me she loved me.
I never said I was an artist.
If it's not one thing, it's another.
Where did you get on this bus?
You must be cautious.
That shop has many customers.
I don't need to be here anymore.
You're lying to me.
The door will be painted tomorrow.
What did you open it with?
I spilled my drink.
Do I look fat?
I don't know what Tom said to Mary.
I need to have a word with you in my office.
She slowly closed her eyes.
You're extroverted.
What's the time now?
You ought to have seen it.
I didn't understand what was happening.
This is a pretty amazing place.
I had a very good day yesterday.
Is there a man in your life?
I'm early.
Take out the trash.
Don't throw that away.
Smiles do not always indicate pleasure.
You're depressed, aren't you?
The best thing about working in a team is that, when something goes wrong, you can always blame someone else.
That's right.
I never did that.
I'm your partner.
Tom decided to enter the room.
I'm starting to dislike her.
He's always complaining about the food.
Tom went inside.
In fact, she's quite unreliable.
Eat your veggies.
I really do have to go.
I'm all yours.
You're wrong. That's not what I said.
Can you tell me the time, please?
Generally, men are taller than women.
How much is it?
Gunshot residue was found on Tom's hands.
I know it's a lie.
I understand your frustration.
I should've known it was you.
I need to talk to someone.
I used a computer in order to save time.
I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
We're astonished.
Did you go out?
She asked him some questions, but he refused to answer.
What's the fastest way to get to the post office?
You look a lot like your brother.
I don't know when he'll come.
That's what happens 99% of the time.
Your driver's license has expired.
My father used to read to me at bedtime.
Wait for your sister.
Do you want a drink or not?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I would appreciate any information you can send to us.
I remember it.
I'm just a plain office worker.
I talked to everybody.
My life would be completely empty without you.
I am free this afternoon.
I want to take a shower.
Don't let the cat escape. Close the door!
Of course I remember you.
I wasn't at that meeting.
Why would anybody want to kill you?
I thought I'd surprise you.
How did you come to hear of it?
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
I appreciate your advice.
Tom is the man of my dreams.
It's cheap.
They found the room empty.
You should carry out your duty.
She advised me where to stay.
This work is simple enough that even a child can do it.
I've never come across such a strange case.
I think we're ready to go.
I never did get it right.
His sweater is gray.
Can you wake me up at 7:00 tomorrow?
Do you think it's my fault?
Is she all right?
I'm confused.
I don't think that's possible.
He rejected our offer.
She had already gone to bed when I called her at 11 p.m.
Would you please tell me the way?
Everyone was looking at me.
Can I borrow your car?
Could you please tell me again where you put the key?
It's worse than I thought.
Tom is a divorce attorney.
Tom should be here any minute.
Don't make fun of children.
Changes came quickly.
As soon as she heard the bell ring, she answered the telephone.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
I sell cars.
My heart was in my throat.
He said something to my friend.
Does it work?
I want time instead of money.
My girlfriend was crying.
I want to dance.
I had trouble pronouncing his name.
You're still young.
It was because of the storm that the trains were halted.
Was there much damage?
Theory and practice should go hand in hand.
I can see just as well as you can.
He is a very irritating critic of others.
You should've told Tom that a long time ago.
Tom converted about half of his yen into dollars and the other half into euros.
That would be really great.
She insisted on my going there.
The boy was searching for the lost key.
He wants to be different.
Can you tell me the time?
If you want quality, pay for it.
We're useless.
Are you almost ready?
I tried to do all I could.
I don't drink.
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
He is actually not the manager.
What do you say to going out for a short walk?
What a nice surprise!
I have a lot of love for you.
She's not penniless.
He laughed at me.
Do you think it's possible for me to ever sound like a native speaker?
The students disobeyed their teacher.
It's not getting worse.
Even the cleverest students can make silly mistakes.
All of a sudden, the fire alarm went off.
There is an urgent need for food and water.
Has the mailman already come?
Do you know what they want?
They welcomed me warmly, so I felt at home.
I used to dream about becoming a model.
You must exercise more care in writing English.
He fetched some water from the well.
A button has come off my coat.
I don't even know if Tom is still alive.
I've got a pair of sunglasses.
The news soon spread all over the village.
I have no further questions.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I want for you and me to be happy.
You won't be shot.
The place was almost empty.
There is a little hope that he will succeed.
I don't want to think about it.
She lives near the beach, but she can't swim.
Today I don't feel like doing anything.
Were you spying on me?
You don't have a clue.
Tom saw something.
They're right behind you.
It's all yours.
You could've been hurt.
I made a couple calls.
I found this book interesting from start to finish.
I'd like to discuss some problems we've been having.
I can't say I'm shocked.
Quakers believe that all people are equal.
I just want to help you.
I guess I could use some advice.
Tom would like to see Mary.
Many small companies went bankrupt.
I would like a word with you.
He can't run very fast.
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
She just wrote a book.
He was drunk and angry.
The snowstorm raged for a full week.
My father quit drinking.
Nobody cares how much the dinner is going to cost.
Tom means what he says.
Please come to my house in the afternoon.
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow.
The amount of time you spend practicing the trumpet is up to you.
If it gets boring, I will go home.
You're running a big risk in trusting him.
I will pick him up at the station.
We're both witnesses.
It's incredibly easy to cheat the system.
I go to bed about ten.
He can play tennis very well.
Here's a photo of her.
Why don't we go for a drive?
I had to see you.
I'm shorter than him.
We'll stand.
You don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it.
Who are we?
Can you remember the first time you heard the Beatles?
Can you translate that into French?
The crops need rain.
I think about him often.
He can hardly speak.
I'm over eighteen.
Is this seat empty?
I need you to see this.
The union was modest in its wage demands.
You don't sound very confident.
I didn't think this was your seat.
That car dealership has a reputation for selling lemons.
I've never been abroad.
They accused me of being a liar.
Did he show you the picture?
Can I sleep on your couch?
Not all girls are like that.
I can see myself in the mirror.
Let's come back to it later.
Is that all you want to say?
You've turned up at the right moment.
She can't bear the noise.
I'm not joking.
I'm in luck.
Read Lesson 10 from the beginning.
Have you ever broken a bone?
You're disgusting.
I have to take some photos for my class project.
I hear you were grounded.
Both of the brothers are dead.
I think you deserve more than this.
Why did you join the Army?
He didn't see a thing.
This is just the type of car I want.
Where do you get off telling me anything?
Many museums are closed on Mondays.
You can't be forced to testify against your husband.
I am not on call tomorrow.
I could tell you that I love you, but I'd be lying.
She often comes late.
Snakes are reptiles.
Tom said he wanted to help.
I've got plenty of money.
When can I visit you?
I really regret doing that.
How about going for a walk after lunch?
We've been talking about you.
The train wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be.
What would you like for dessert?
We could keep it a secret.
Every man has his price.
I think that's just what I need right now.
I love her so much I could die.
I'd like to find out what this is.
A permanent costs extra.
That's it. I've done all I can do.
Mine is better than yours.
Tom stepped into the elevator and pushed the button for the third floor.
I'm happy you two are friends again.
Can I take a shower?
You've been warned.
He acted in his own interest.
Is his pulse regular?
It is still light outside.
How many hours a day do you spend in your office?
I can't believe he kissed you.
You're new here, aren't you?
There's nowhere for you to hide.
I am right.
Don't make fun of me.
All the songs I sang for you today were written by me.
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
Will I have the pleasure of seeing you again?
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
Where's your other shoe?
I was happy for him.
Is there something in particular that you want to know?
That's cheap, isn't it?
Why do you want to die?
I remember them.
Is it a deer?
I believe he is coming tomorrow.
It's our only hope.
This is our only hope.
I have a lot of work to do today.
Bring me the menu, please.
The light is off.
Would you buy that?
I thought you were supposed to be at school now.
They made him work.
Why did you keep it a secret?
She was absorbed in the video.
What you're doing right now is a crime.
Are you certain?
I don't see how that's possible.
I heard that Tom doesn't sing anymore.
I love going to the beach.
I don't have a bedtime.
It was a fine sunny day.
Who is the man that you were talking with?
I don't live around here.
Let me ask you something, Tom.
The noise gets on my nerves.
How did you know that Tom's passport was in the bottom drawer?
He is poor at chemistry.
He is strong as a horse.
Is that your umbrella?
One of my dreams is to one day see the aurora borealis.
In case of emergency, call the police.
Are you still sleepy?
Coffee is Brazil's main product.
She is very becoming in a black party dress.
It has been raining since Tuesday.
Tom is a good teacher, isn't he?
Why are you dressed like that?
Tom took Mary's hands and held them tightly.
We're having company.
You drive a hard bargain.
Your question has no answer.
He kept me waiting for an hour.
I cried all night long.
Someone stole my tennis racket.
I'd rather stay home than go fishing.
You can't get on this bus.
I'm jittery.
I had the boy carry my bag.
She was asked to convince him to paint the house.
She made me a cake.
I assume you've heard from Tom.
I made a list.
I can open the window.
I like watermelon.
I really am glad you're here.
I think we should follow Tom.
Are you still playing golf?
This is the third longest river in the world.
What's the score?
It's cheaper to take the bus.
It was quite an experience.
It's serious.
Do you think I'm fat?
I was in a better mood three hours ago.
Did we win?
I'd like to stay here a little longer.
He is a head taller than me.
What'll it cost?
What have you come here for?
My father has just returned from abroad.
You'll have to cook more food.
We're almost ready.
You're a menace.
The couple broke off their engagement.
How will you manage without a job?
He is wandering around in a trance.
Don't you drag me into this.
Christmas is December 25th.
I'm still single.
She passed by without seeing me.
Tom could've done it by himself.
That's evident.
The girl resembles her mother very much.
You're kind of cute.
He's now a college student.
I was surprised at the news of his sudden death.
What are you so angry about?
Anybody could do this.
I don't know which of you is crazier.
They tried to cheer me up.
Nobody likes being laughed at.
They come from the same town.
Aren't you going to open the box?
It's obvious that he's right.
I hadn't thought about that.
I may know someone who can help you.
You can lie to everyone else, but you can't lie to yourself.
I didn't get a chance to introduce myself to her.
I have responsibilities.
I agree with what you said.
Was I wrong?
They braved the snow storm.
Don't you see what that means?
The kids are disappointed.
Tom is sleeping like a baby.
I appreciate your support.
I'm going to put a curse on you.
I did it the way he told me to.
I just have one other thing to do.
I'm tired of watching television.
I have one sister.
Tom looks bewildered.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
He seems kind.
Get in the van.
I didn't know Tom was dying.
They were frustrated.
He attributed his failure to bad luck.
Are you still playing the guitar?
I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
If you take this medicine, you'll feel better.
I'm in love with somebody else.
His name is known to me.
I rewrote my report.
Can we go over my options?
All of them went there.
The unrest lasted three days.
My sister asked me to teach her how to ski.
These people are desperate and devoid of hope.
Bunnies are so cute.
Let's get a cup of coffee.
Don't do anything stupid, OK?
Is there anything you want to know?
I'll have another.
What are you doing with these dolls?
Tell me I'm not dreaming.
He refused to do much campaigning.
Staying at home is boring.
The noise will wake the baby up.
I'm looking for batteries.
When is your book coming out?
He asked for a cigarette.
You should be careful not to become overconfident.
He begged for his life.
Maybe you should go to Boston.
You're not a killer and neither am I.
You can't be thirty years old.
If what you say is true, it follows that he has an alibi.
He burned himself badly.
I have so much to show you.
Don't make me lose my patience.
Who are these presents for?
I asked him not to bother me.
Tom decided to cooperate.
Are we ready?
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be.
My uncle died of cancer of the stomach yesterday.
He is angry with you.
After I finished my homework, I watched baseball on TV.
It's a very good newspaper, isn't it?
Please give me the letter.
We just got here.
What is it this time?
How many beers did you drink?
I tried.
I know neither of them.
Show me your passport, please.
I want my dinner brought to my room.
You can have someone do it for you.
I was really shocked.
That's absolutely right.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
Did you forget something?
I almost shot you.
Stop being cruel.
He abused my confidence.
You are twice as strong as me.

It's not as bad as it seems.
She waited for him to call.
I had been reading for an hour when he came in.

What are you working on?
I have billions of dollars.
I think I'm going back to sleep.
I saw the file.
He was the last to leave.
I told you to leave.

I saw a figure approaching in the distance.
It's starting to snow.
He kept on crying.

I just want your love.
She did not say anything.
They even named their boy after you.
You must respect your elders.
He isn't happy at all.

I don't expect you to understand it.
I didn't want to wait for anything.
How many bags did you have?
We were expecting a lot of snow.
I'm thinking of going.
I won't say it again.

I think it's time for me to get a new pair of glasses.
She's about the same age as my older sister.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
I need sugar.
Don't be upset.
Take a look at this report.
I had difficulty getting a ticket for the concert.
Tom wasn't in his room.
I left my umbrella here last night.
I just got back in town.
Tom went to his room, changed into his pajamas, and got into bed.
Do we have to get up early tomorrow morning?
I know how hard it is to do that.
This book is still copyrighted.
Here I come.
Am I dreaming?
This is all that's left.
I know you've been trying to help.
Who is that gentleman?
I'm really not supposed to do this.
I'm already done.
Thank you for your concern.
Is that what you really want to do?
You'll always be welcome here.
She is popular with other girls.
You expect too much of your child.
I did that earlier today.
This laptop belongs to me.
Why doesn't anybody help you?

Where's Tom this morning?
An athlete must keep in good condition.
I get up at 6 o'clock every morning.
Is it a compliment or an insult?
You're the laziest person I know.
He's intimidated by beautiful women.
Here comes Tom.
Your house is nicer than mine.
Do you want to go shopping with me?
Can I at least get a hug?
I thought you'd got lost.
She went shopping.
He is so honest that everybody trusts him.
I'll try to remember that.
Tom sorted the mail.
He vowed to give up smoking.
This newspaper is free.
The sun sank slowly below the horizon.
Come and see me.
I'm normal.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
I didn't receive even one letter from her.
She complained that the picture was too revealing.
He dropped the cup and broke it.
I found a pair of gloves under the chair.
Look under the seat.
This is messed up.
I like what I do.
Mary dyed her hair blue.
I didn't know you could speak French.
The company is in the red.
Let him go.
He made reference to the previous director.
I thought I'd never see you alive again.
You're confused.
I can't believe you just did that.
Do you like to be alone?
I often travel.
Tom has a lot of valuable books.
Maybe we really are alone.
None of us are happy.
We like him.
Why do you need a doctor?
I can swim very fast.
Those are old wives' tales.
Please stop talking.

Did I wake you up?
Tom likes to cook Chinese food.
Do you know how long they have been married?
Don't even get me started.
Who was this picture painted by?
I was very disappointed.
He stood up.
Life seems so unfair.
I'm aware of my responsibilities.
I promise to return this videotape within a week.
I have two sisters and one brother.
You're very timid.
We must stick together.
My dog needs a walk.
May I ask what you're working on?
I thought that he was rich.
I guess I just got carried away.
I'll tell you afterwards.
Don't make fun of other people.
The doctor will be here in a minute.
One of the boys suddenly ran away.
You're the first person I told that to.
Double-click the icon.
I can't find time to read the book.
Those colors go well together.
I don't think he can help you.
I can't put up with him any longer.
They did not listen.
He cussed me out for having lied to him.
This is taking way too long.
I'll help.
If you keep trying, you will make progress.
There wasn't any special hurry.
Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17th.
Someone is coming.
What does it feel like to always have people following you around?
There was a modern-looking coffee table in the center of the room.
Who sent you?
Please help yourself to the cake.
This room is very stuffy.
I was devastated.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
He is a writer.
You're losing.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
She doesn't understand you.
Is that your car in the driveway?
I work in Milan.
She used to be a very shy girl.
I was impressed with what I saw.
I can't blame him.
My roommate complained about the noise.
Don't even talk to me.

I'm sorry I hurt you.
It's for your own safety.
You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.
I don't believe a word Tom says.
I belong to the music club.
She is as busy as a bee.
I don't need to be here.
Tom's family was also there.
He came when I was out.
He was accused falsely.
She really got on my nerves.
You're incredible.
I slipped and fell on the icy sidewalk.
Put your hands up in the air!
I didn't know anyone was there.
Take your hand out of your pocket.
I can't help anymore.
He consoled himself with the thought that it might have been worse.
Tell me what I did wrong.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
Help yourself to these cookies.
Your troubles are just beginning.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
I bought a book of folktales.
What crimes have you committed?
Do you care for classical music?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
It's a slippery one.
Who is able to explain this to me?
He is standing on the stage.
You look busy.
I'm not arguing.
The chances are that the bill will be rejected.
Have you finished your work?
Tom couldn't answer all of Mary's questions.
Japan has a high population density.
I slept very well.
Tom is very mean.
I'm writing a song in French.
Previously people believed the earth was flat.
What he needs most is a good job.
Which do you usually drink, wine or beer?
I had dinner ready for you.
What are your duties?
Hasn't Tom arrived yet?
What are you going to do if it rains?
I can't get the door to shut properly.
I'm a dancer.
They'll be all right.
Meeting boys is hard.
We met at summer camp.
Tom knows that Mary can't speak French.
I want to learn karate.
I got sick of the constant noise of the street traffic.
You don't look your age.
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
It was his bicycle that was stolen.
I think that's the best answer.
Let me try something.
It's best to put covers on paperbacks.
The moment she was alone, she opened the letter.
She went shopping with him last Monday.
Did you hear it?
I love gardening.
There was only one survivor of the accident.
I have something I want to tell you.
The door was difficult to open.
I never forgot you.
Tom tried to tell Mary what she needed to do.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Tom smokes three packs of cigarettes a day.
One of your neighbors complained.
She's always complaining about the food.
This is what I want to do.
He fell in love with a younger woman.
You write well.
It's adorable.
I'll lend you the tools that you need to do that.
She rejected my proposal.
I've got some chores to do.
Tom and Mary weren't impressed.
Can he see me?
I left my guitar in your office.
The old lady lived in a three-room apartment by herself.
She called to tell him that she'd be late.
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary.
Thank you for the information.
I will go even if it rains.
Can you do some shopping for me?
You made me lose my mind.
They talked about culture.
I think Tom could be sick.
He was the last to leave.
A river flows through the valley.
Do you plan to buy that car?
As I got the train this morning, I met an old friend of mine.
We were soldiers.
Children need love.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to live.
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
Life is enjoyable.
Who is this boy?
Tom is taller than Mary.
I hope you enjoyed it.
I like the color of your car.
He has all kinds of books.
I received a letter from her.
Let it be.
I came across this book in a secondhand bookstore.
They're part of us.
I study Japanese history.
I used to be the same age as you.
I can't look at this photo without feeling very sad.
People rose in revolt against the King.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever held in my arms.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
I intend to study abroad next year.
Everybody wants to protect you.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
I'm not entirely sure.
I can't keep up with you if you walk so fast.
It's against my principles.
Let's go and see as many things as we can.
I think we should head back.
Give me back the book after you have read it.
Show yourself.
If you're not listening to the radio, turn it off.
I've got a lot of things to do this week.
Of course, he is right.
You want me to do your dirty work for you, don't you?
Let's mosey on down to the river.
Her late husband was a violinist.
Why are they protesting?
He is rich and I am poor.
I don't want you to enjoy it.
You don't have to take an examination.
I owe you a lot.
It would be a good idea if I went.
What is the temperature?
Tom wanted to be a pharmacist.
The Catholic Church is opposed to divorce.
You cannot take back what you have said.
Let me show you around our house.
Tom comes here about three times a year.
I was more than a little embarrassed.
All at once there was an explosion.
I live in Boston with my family.
Would it be possible for me to get something to drink?
We're in control.
Tom ordered a drink.
This is something I must face alone.
This is my first time, so I'm a little nervous.
Unlock the door.
Grades are important, but they are not everything.
Each time I see this picture, I remember my father.
Call me this evening.
I don't really care how you do it.
I asked him if he knew my name.
I guess I just got carried away.
I always drive at a moderate speed.
When was the last time you hunted?
Do turtles have teeth?
I'm very interested in learning French.
I went skiing a lot as a kid.
Keep quiet.
You could do it if you really wanted to.
That was awesome.
The snow prevented the train from running.
I am of the opinion that this is the way to do it.
Please write down your name.
Are you lost?
No matter how hard I try, I can't remember the exact words.
I stuck my hands in my pockets.
I think you should see a doctor.
I want you to die.
I'm getting undressed.
Do you know of any inexpensive stores?
It'll be hard to persuade Tom.
I have to admit I'm interested.
He uses the same dictionary as I do.
That bed is very comfortable.
It's not as easy as you think.
This is yours.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
That kind of behavior is unacceptable.
My dad gave up alcohol.
Is that correct?
You won't believe your eyes.
Tom certainly doesn't speak for all of us.
Does Tom dye his hair?
All the money put together still won't be enough.
I don't have any books to read.
Please deposit the money in a bank.
Tom can't see without his glasses.
Nothing unexpected happened.
It's not so good.
Do you get up at six?
I really enjoy spending time with you.
Do you want to discuss it?
I didn't want to intrude.
I suppose I asked too many questions.
What are you waiting for?
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
What is the length of this piece of cloth?
I have a great deal to do tonight.
Will he be here soon?
Books are for people who wish they were somewhere else.
I haven't seen her since last month.
Thirteen Americans were killed.
We're not dating.
I'm not miserable.
I've got lots of questions.
She has been dating him for about two years.
I just had a bad dream.
Do you recognize anyone?
I saw something very bright fly across the night sky.
Be careful!
I know what they'll want me to do.
She is blackmailing him.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
I cried like a baby.
Can't you help us?
These are questions worth discussing.
We're getting married in three months.
Traffic accidents are increasing in number.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
I had a really great time last night.
Let me go.
I'd like to forget the whole thing.
I regret going there.
Would you please allow me to treat you to dinner next week?
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
How much did they give you for your old car?
Anybody can participate.
About how much will I have to pay for all the treatments?
Tom's not the slightest bit interested in my suggestion.
You are so childish sometimes.
I was so humiliated.
Tom has short legs.
She is a kind girl.
I'm quite certain I don't want to be married to you.
Tom never really trusted Mary.

I'm pleasantly surprised by that.
I don't like your friends.
Run and hide in the mountains.
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
I want to be here with you.
Tom still laughs about it.
We know enough.
Of course, you're correct.
Excuse me, is there a hotel around here?
Who gave you this envelope?
We're getting there.
Something's happened to it.
They moved in recently.
I can understand your point of view.
We are here.
Someone should talk to him and tell him what's what.
Would you mind lending me your car?
Tom and Mary like the same kind of food.
Come a bit closer.
I have only just begun.
According to the newspaper, it's going to rain today.
I'll call you later today.
Her cardigan was unbuttoned.
You heard your mother.
Tom used to live in Boston.
I think it's time for me to mow the lawn.
What could be the meaning of it?
Stop crying.
Don't tell anybody.
Tom ignored our advice.
I didn't tell anybody.
The danger is minimal.
I cringed.
I've heard rumors about you and Tom.
I just did what you told me to do.
It's been five years since my father died.
Does she know your phone number?
Those twins look like two peas in a pod.
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
Where are your parents now?
Tom is obsessed with power and money.
I just want a little more time.
A fuse has blown.
You have done very well.
Please let me off in front of that building.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
He asked a very good question.
Are you an only child?
She goes running every morning.
Tom has an older brother named John.
She lost her way and on top of that it began to rain.
You go there without me.
You aren't a spy, are you?
No one goes there anymore.
Do you remember anything?
That's the difference.
I want to see a doctor about my stomachache.
I'll be in the truck.
It is not a real mansion.
I don't earn enough money to buy clothes regularly.
Had it not been for his aid, I could not have finished the work.
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
There is an exception to every rule.
There's a chance that tap water may contain harmful substances like chlorine and lead.
Is it an emergency?
What do you remember?
There are happy people and unhappy people.
He came to London by way of Siberia.
He didn't see anything.
It goes without saying that smoking is bad for the health.
It seems that something has happened.
Good for you.
That can't be good for you.
They talked about it on the telephone.
The murder happened between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.
He ordered us steaks.
What was your favorite part?
Are you on drugs or something?
I have nothing to do this afternoon.
Try to control yourself.
They're in the shower.
Will it take long to recover?
Stop smoking.
Let's eat now. I'm dying of hunger.
I have been to the library.
Do what he tells you.
Don't be afraid.
I dream about you quite often.
What was her answer to your proposal?
This is for your protection.
Just do what you have to do.
Whether he wrote it or not will always remain a secret.
Do you mean you're giving up?
We shouldn't be seen together.
As we went around the corner, the lake came into view.
She has a sense of fashion.
I can keep a secret.
You look busy.
I kept hoping I'd meet Tom.
Tennis is loads of fun.
That's not really my job.
I have no idea why it is so.
He continued walking for a while.
The world is changing.
Why is this light blinking?
Tom hoped to succeed.
The children broke the ancient urn.
Aren't you a banker?
My gums are swollen.
I've got so much left to do.
It was not until yesterday that we noticed the animal missing.
Is it cruel to declaw your cat?
I can't save you this time.
Are you about done?
Is your daughter here?
Somebody just called.
We hate violence.
They were swimming.
She plans to stay at the Oriental Hotel.
Can I go swimming, Mother?
It's still raining.
I often hear her refer to her childhood.
We were all tired.
I made you coffee.
When I didn't know how to answer the question, he gave me a hint.
Put it there, not here.
Do you mind if I sleep here?
He put the key on the desk as usual.
His father is conservative and old-fashioned.
I'm sorry to interrupt you while you're talking.
What did you think of the wedding?
I used to do that as a kid.
Which is your suitcase?
It was very cold this morning.
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
We played many kinds of games.
Is there any difference between your idea and hers?
What have they done to you?
Why didn't you run away?
Tom is much taller than you are.
Let me treat you next time, then.
I'd like you to look after my dog during my absence.
Stop talking loudly.
This is impossible for me.
What do you say we go for a swim?
May I interrupt you?
The family is watching a movie together.
Don't leave your dog inside all day.
I can't believe you actually said that.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Don't thank me now.
Let's not get carried away.
Tom told me that he wants to meet my parents.
What time will the flight arrive in Tokyo?
I'll drive you somewhere.
Who was the man you were talking to?
I'm the one who painted this picture.
Are there kids?
I ran so I would be on time.
We finally have you where we want you.
That's entirely possible.
They must be cops.
Tom was hiding behind a tree.
Life in prison is worse than the life of an animal.
He's very ill.
Don't leave the water running.
Stop whining like a baby.
Are you sure we've never met before?
I get the feeling you don't really want me to stay.
I would rather feed my dog before we eat.
I'm exhausted.
Tom has three mobile phones.
I don't know how to get there.
Warm and humid weather increases the number of crimes.
I've been waiting all night.
Don't come to me with any excuses.
The restaurant was far from the station.
How's your family?
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
This is how the accident happened.
I like old cars.
When will he go home?
That bus stops in front of my house.
Who's Tom looking at?
He got the twelve o'clock train.
The twins are as alike as two peas in a pod.
They ate up all the cake.
Do you have a snow shovel?
How many of the words on this list do you not know?
Who have you told so far?
I know I have a lot to learn.
It's a very stressful job.
This diamond is fake.
Some people are fascinated by shiny new things.
I don't know how to say it.
I don't know Boston that well.
You should have taken a chance then.
Tom hates me as much as I hate him.
I don't think I can trust you anymore.
I know you're in love with me.
If you really cared about your girlfriend, you would respect her feelings.
Contact me for more information.
Things did not go as intended.
There is an urgent need for peace talks.
That happened over a year ago.
I saw the man knocked down by a car.
Air is lighter than water.
How long have you been living on Park Street?
Do you want to watch TV?
I thought Tom was in school.
Reading books will make you smarter.
Let them do their job.
The reverse seems true.
I'm not racist.
We don't live in Boston.
I appreciate you calling me.
I live pretty close to here.
The paper didn't carry the story.
Few students knew his name.
Could you move the chair a bit?
I have to go.
We have to learn all the songs before the end of the week.
You won't be the only one there.
What time is good for you?
I think I'm a pretty good singer.
I awoke on the floor.
Why should we study economics?
Are you a high school student?
These senseless killings will not go unpunished.
I gave Tom a huge hug.
Tom quit his job.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
I think I've made a big mistake.
I woke up at five this morning.
I have to explain this to Tom.
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
That part is frustrating.
Tom sometimes walks to work.
I have at least ten books.
He fits the description in the newspaper.
Can we close the door?
This form looks kind of complicated. Help me fill it out.
War is not inevitable.
He knows his job.
Find me a glass.
I didn't take the wrong umbrella.
I don't know what's happened.
I miss Boston.
He majored in drama at college.
We're looking for some computer-savvy people to work for us.
We're meditating.
Our ammunition has run out.
You have to choose your own path.
I didn't mean to pry.
I have no idea how I got here.
Keep away from the fire.
Please don't tell my wife.
A team of paramedics is standing by.
If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research, would it?
Some of my best friends are policemen.
Aren't you annoyed by that?
I'm not all that busy.
That's all I needed to hear.
You wouldn't have won without me.
Which is your suitcase?
We can't tell anyone.
I feel very chilly.
Who's that cute boy?
I used to weigh seventy kilos.
These light bulbs can't all be bad.
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
How certain are you that he's a criminal?
Come quickly!
We could really use another person around here.
Why do you study French?
I'm not very good at backgammon.
I wish nothing but the best for you.
I have to be back home by seven.
They can't start without me.
I don't have a girlfriend anymore.
I like neither of the pictures.
She devoted her life to helping the handicapped.
What is the matter with you?
I don't gamble.
He has broken the record.
You said you had a theory.
We know all this.
The door was already open.
Nothing is forgiven.
I think it's strange that he didn't speak to you.
She's rather clueless.
I lost my car key.
We're still involved.
Wouldn't that be something?
You're very sophisticated.
Stop crying.
I don't like our new coach.
Quit behaving like a kid.
It seems logical to me.
I'm not in the least afraid of it.
Tom has a house in Boston.
Everyone's going to be tired.
What do you want to do when you grow up?
Pass me the salt.
Put it down.
He was absent at roll call.
Can you express yourself in English?
That accident is a very good example of what happens when you're not careful.
I don't know why I reacted that way.
What do you think is in the box?
This won't take long.
You can make your own.
Napoleon lived in exile on the island of Elba.
He donated countless pieces to the museum.
I don't think we need to do it.
I'll get my keys.
Close your eyes.
Are you really not going?
I'm fed up with English.
Tom is an imposter.
This factory produces 500 automobiles a day.
As for me, I like this better.
Can you help me?
You don't even know how.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
No one can see.
Be careful not to drink too much.
You should've called me.
He fainted in the middle of his speech.
I'm not very good at chess.
I'm a farmer.
You look gorgeous in that dress.
I could get you fired, you know.
Tom told Mary that she was the fattest woman he'd ever seen.
That never should've happened.
Are you looking for something?
Can we trust Tom to do that?
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
How does this disease spread?
Will you pick me up at seven tomorrow morning?
She called out to us for help.
It is hardly raining.
He nodded to me as he passed.
We all live on planet Earth.
I went on with my reading.
I really do hope that you'll do that without complaining.
It was very cold.
What's your favorite game?
Who cares about me?
You're very nice.
A gentleman wouldn't do such a thing.
Columbus discovered America in 1492.
I can't blame you. It was my fault.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Don't stay up all night.
You will be able to read this book next year.
You need to be careful when you're driving a car.
Don't listen to her.
He'll be back by five o'clock.
That's not true.
I'm very worried about you.
His ideas never earned him even one penny.
It's my turn.
She worked for a rich man.
I've been to Hokkaido before.
She had nothing to do yesterday.
We're all infected.
This is our main goal.
If you don't know, who does?
I know how to drive a car.
Ukrainian girls are the most beautiful girls in the world.
Tom had to leave early.
There's no food left.
Please write your name here.
I just can't understand you sometimes.
He is very brave.
I haven't been home in a while.
Would you like to dance?
Tom doesn't know the difference between a wolf and a fox.
Why did you side with him instead of me?
We need to make a big decision.
I'm not used to this heat.
Both Tom and Mary are very hungry.
You're too young to marry.
Did I tell you about my party this Friday?
You can get a loan from a bank.
Have a nice trip.
You're not very funny.
I unfortunately drew a wrong conclusion.
Tom really wants to lose weight.
We tried to cheer him up.
Everyone laughed.
I love winning.
I'm buying myself a new pair of shoes.
I am thankful for the food I eat.
I support you a hundred percent.
I don't feel like studying.
We're resilient.
Tom only knows how to speak French.
He eats a lot.
Something isn't right.
The tower leaned slightly to the left.
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
I can do this.
Your efforts came to nothing.
I expected you to be here for lunch.
I can no longer remain silent.
He has poor eyesight.
How did you get to know Mary?
Can you give us your point of view?
I want to eat something.
After I got married, my Japanese got better and I could understand more.
Would you like to freshen up?
I don't know how to do that.
I can run as fast as Tom.
I've never cared about such things.
She quickly opened the letter.
I want you to want me.
It's quite natural for him to think so.
What'll they do to Tom?
I don't like shellfish.
That's lovely.
He is proficient in English.
It's the third of October.
We're all angry.
How much do you remember?
Tom opened the car door to get in.
What Tom said didn't make sense.
You should tell the truth.
I don't take it personally.
Have you already eaten?
Tom asked Mary for something to drink.
I've had enough.
I have lots of friends.
I have nothing to declare.
We might find something.
I don't have time to explain.
I don't like being interrogated.
There is no other choice.
He saved us all.
We're lucky Tom is here to help us do this.
He gets a haircut three times a month.
I appreciate your telling me.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
There is an urgent need for a new policy.
I love the way you walk.
Are you ready for today's game?
She presented him with the trophy.
I'm surviving.
Walk this way.
Is everything ready?
The grenade blew up before the terrorist could throw it, and his arm was blown off!
The food is spoiled.
My brother loves taking pictures of mountains.
You're restless.
Those houses are big.
Did I hurt your feelings?
He is mad about music.
What makes you think that isn't true?
You were my friend.
You shouldn't have done that.
You probably just want to be alone.
There's really no reason for you to go to Boston.
I told you not to call me on weekends.
People can't live forever.
The day started off very well.
He didn't look happy.
This is kind of sudden, isn't it?
You're very upset.
I'd love to sing for you.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Don't eat without me.
These pictures were painted by him.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
He has two daughters, both married.
He didn't believe it at first.
He is acquainted with the modern history of France.
Don't you have any good news?
I am not well at all.
I wasn't sure where I belonged.
I'm willing to go anywhere you go.
It's late, so turn off the TV.
Who're you calling now?
His horse jumped over the fence.
I won't say it again.
The door is closing.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Men know nothing about women.
I'm not angry anymore.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
The most common name in the world is Mohammed.
I'm not done.
Don't forget that good jobs are very hard to come by these days.
I want to go to college.
Where exactly did you go?
Americans eat special foods on Thanksgiving.
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile.
We offered him a nice job.
I think both of them are right.
I've always fed my dogs in the early evening.
The new boss runs a really tight ship.
Can this wait till morning?
Everything's very cheap.
He went to Paris by car yesterday.
Actually, the problem isn't new.
I didn't care.
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
Don't cheat.
The box he found was empty.
He takes after his father.
I asked for my father's help.
I don't know where he went.
Tom asked me if I was sleepy.
Having finished lunch, we went skating.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
How many inhabitants are there?
You're not welcome here.
We'll talk at dinner.
I'm sick of lying.
Do you know where he bought his camera?
I've given up on the idea of buying a house.
May I look at the menu?
They're barely paid minimum wage.
How long did it take you to translate this book?
Let me finish.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
I'd like to sing a song.
Tom doesn't want to hurt you.
He worked hard to save up some money.
I don't know if I should tell you.
He was killed by a blunt weapon.
You don't have to tell me this.
Tom died last year.
His bicycle is different from this one.
This is too big.
I don't think we can guarantee your safety.
I was overwhelmed.
Is this enough?
Please knock on the door.
I felt guilty about it.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
You should run for president.
She liked that.
So, are you seeing anyone?
I figured I'd find you here.
Tom's rather busy just now.
They're right behind me.
You're starting to annoy me.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
Does she know your telephone number?
We drank some wine.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I'm thorough.
It is good for us to understand other cultures.
I don't believe that Santa Claus is imaginary.
Let me buy you a new one.
We were destined to meet one day.
Is this seat empty?
Let's call the whole thing off.
He instantly fell in love with her.
I'll leave no stone unturned to find out who did this.
She cooked us a delicious dinner.
Eating fish is good for your health.
Everything is over.
We shared the profit among us all.
Stop trying to cheer me up.
You're not bruised.
Be at the train station at eleven sharp.
Find me a glass.
I'm not deaf.
She closed her eyes.
This would embarrass anyone.
Do you know when they will arrive?
He's new in town.
How did it get here?
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would have exploded.
The mere sight of a mosquito makes her sick.
The river which flows through Paris is the Seine.
Go.
I've never even had a girlfriend.
Have you ever visited Kyoto?
I suppose you enjoy that sort of thing.
We miss you a lot.
I need a breather.
I think what Tom is doing is amazing.
Come join us.
Mary has beautiful handwriting.
I gather you were hurt.
Which is your guitar?
Tom can't speak French well.
We want you to take it.
I was taken advantage of.
She put up with the pain quite well.
We're going to need water.
Don't phone her now.
Do you mind if I tag along?
My sister plays the piano every day.
It was raining hard, but she insisted on going for a drive.
Tom gave them a general idea of what he wanted.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I looked down.
Come on, answer quickly.
He will do his best to finish it on time.
I just don't want you to get upset.
You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
Wasn't it enough?
May I ask you a favor?
She is a difficult person to deal with.
She promised not to go out alone.
Do you have any water?
How can you be so selfish?
I was hoping you'd be here today.
Good job!
Everyone jumped into the pool.
He's still single.
The lights are on.
Are you going to mow the lawn today?
He is going to buy a new bicycle next week.
You're not good at this.
He thinks that his success is due to luck.
Enjoy your stay.
You missed the meeting.
This is the guide who took us around the castle.
She passed away two days ago.
I can't see a thing.
He was destined to become a great musician.
She married him.
My door is always open.
Some students aren't going to come back next semester.
Don't fish in this river. It's prohibited.
Can you empty the dishwasher?
Don't speak so fast, please.
Tom is at school.
I didn't eat dinner last night.
You owe me a kiss.
It was a waste of time.
She didn't know what to do.
I'll just get you started.
He added a little sugar to the coffee.
You must show respect to your guests.
Nothing is achieved without effort.
You may go anywhere you like.
You can always depend upon her to help.
I had a toothache yesterday.
We reached the top of the mountain.
I think we're pretty lucky.
Don't sneak out of the concert!
He is tall and lean.
How does that sound to you?
That could work.
We never learned what happened or why.
It will be a great pleasure for me to translate the story and to read it to you.
Why is that so funny?
He has never been scolded by his father.
It looks like we're almost out of the woods.
I did it like this.
That's a question we're all asking ourselves.
Excuse me, what time is it?
Did you question them?
Why did they hire you?
If you tell too many lies, people won't ever believe you.
I gave Tom a hug.
Have you lost your ticket?
You're courteous.
I have a cat.
Tom bet Mary that he could beat her at arm wrestling.
Was there anything wrong with the car?
He studied very hard.
I feel like everyone is talking about me behind my back.
That's too hard.
The old man sat all alone.
I'm trapped.
It is two miles from here to the park.
Do you mind much?
I was happy there.
It sounds like you've tried everything.
The politician was thought to be telling the truth.
At last, I caught up with my friends.
I don't know.
Germany has no minimum wage.
I think Tom is drunk.
His father left him the house in his will.
Have you ever heard her sing on stage?
Do you mean to go?
Can you really not swim?
You said it yourself.
I really don't get you.
Would you please open the window?
I'll take care of the cat.
Tom is respected by everybody.
The more you play, the better you'll get.
He is always prepared.
It's raining hard.
I will not help you.
She decided to take legal advice.
I left the room.
He settled down in his armchair to listen to the music.
What's your plan?
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
I want you to handle this.
I hope to hear from you.
My children had eaten all the cookies by the time I got home.
I have an eating disorder.
It is twenty minutes past ten.
Hurry up and get in.
I hope that it rains tomorrow.
He goes running every morning.
This box is full of apples.
I use it.
I always wondered what that noise was.
Are you vegetarian?
I'm all done.
Quite a few shingles flew off the roof during the storm.
What he says is absolutely correct.
We saved you a seat right here.
They're mine.
I made her cry.
I have no friends.
Can you do it faster?
Just give me the gun.
Can you see Tom?
What's with the luggage?
You're powerless.
If that's what you want to do, do it.
You can get rid of the cold if you take this medicine.
We need to band together to beat the enemy.
Japan is a leader in the world's high-tech industry.
My eyes are burning.
Will you have some more tea?
That would be very beneficial.
This girl changed her look.
He behaved himself like a man.
The cat sleeps next to the couch.
I recovered.
Don't be so pessimistic.
He was proud of his daughter.
I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool.
We can't ignore this problem.
How long did you stay in Boston?
Please give me another chance.
Tom broke his nose.
Didn't anyone question you?
What are some foods you usually eat with red wine?
How long did you stay at the party?
I had to face this alone.
Do you think Tom is dangerous?
We are all alike, on the inside.
They're brave.
This is something I must face alone.
Can you take Tom to the airport?
I was given a new jacket.
How many times did you do that?
Snap out of it!
He would not raise my salary.
I'm not ready to do that.
Were you shot at?
Everybody seeks happiness.
I'm waiting for a train.
She always urges him to try new things.
He shook hands with his friend.
He filled up the hole in the wall.
Suddenly, 100 workers were laid off.
Am I the only one that sees the humor in this?
I plan on being early.
Are you ready to begin?
Someone attacked Tom.
Are you new here?
I had my wallet stolen from my inner pocket.
I have never tried Chinese food.
What's that strange smell coming from the kitchen?
Let's see if it really does happen.
Which do you like better, white wine or red wine?
Can it wait?
We are leaving Japan next month.
I like seafood.
My mother is a lawyer.
I can't remember where this little doodad goes.
You should look out for potholes when driving.
How does it feel to be a mother?
Tom was nowhere in sight.
I understand your concern.
I'd like to go to the zoo.
Bring me something to eat.
Can you help me when I move?
He did it, and what was more surprising, he did it by himself.
He is very eager to go there.
I suggest we continue.
Do you have change for a fifty?
This movie is frightening to the children.
The butcher ground the meat.
I played with my brother.
Do you want a banana?
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow.
It wasn't a smart decision.
I prefer reading to writing.
Do you want to argue about it?
Don't go out in this heat without wearing a hat.
I think we'll be OK.
Tom went home with Mary.
I truly didn't know you felt this way.
My sister still lives with our parents.
Yours is over there.
It is uncertain whether he will agree or not.
I just want my past to go away.
Everyone felt safe.
I need to travel.
He can't do that.
I'm lucky today.
I've never even had a girlfriend.
I think we're going to have a very strong team.
They abandoned the ship.
The schoolboys teased each other endlessly.
Do you have a blog?
If it happens to rain, the garden party won't be held.
Hurry up, please.
It wasn't me. It was Tom.
I have a pair of red shoes.
I do not have any more time.
I had nothing to do with it.
Delivery is not included in the price.
Feel this. It's really soft.
You can't be thirty years old.
Are you a lawyer?
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
I'm sitting alone in my house.
Aren't you satisfied?
You seem to be making progress.
I want you to tell me who gave you that.
Do you need an ambulance?
I just want to make sure we all agree.
Are you insured?
We need a place to stay for the night.
He had an unpleasant screechy voice.
He talked to himself.
It was a bad movie.
Is that all you've got to say?
Do you know the reason?
I do not understand.
I don't know why that should surprise me.
What a colossal waste of time!
I have an old car.
He knows how to brush his teeth.
I thought you were working.
I think it's time for me to spend a little time with my children.
Was anybody hurt?
What time is it?
I've lost my car key.
I need to know what's going on.
Tom finished his meal first.
He isn't any older than I thought.
I can't take chances.
Shut your eyes.
She got married at seventeen.
I'd like to be in Paris.
My mother is preparing breakfast.
I suppose you like it.
She struggled to get up.
Nice to meet you.
People can choose to start loving, but can't choose to stop.
I'm not hitting on you.
I will miss you all.
The only thing that matters is that you are safe.
I'm still waiting for Tom to pay me back the money I lent him.
I didn't think that you could do that.
You are twice as strong as me.
I'll go ahead.
The food is spoiled.
The market for luxury goods is growing fast.
I've had a lot on my mind lately.
This isn't funny.
Do I need to pay in advance?
Tom got there long after we did.
She wouldn't let him in.
Are you there?
He usually fed his dog cheap dog food.
Tom wants to get a tattoo on his chest.
Do you have the book?
Mary is beautiful, isn't she?
Memorize it.
Give me something to eat.
Can we please turn this off?
I can open the window.
She expected him to buy her an expensive gift.
I'd never do anything so stupid.
I think Tom will tell you.
I don't have time to do what I want to do.
He saved the drowning boy at the risk of his own life.
Tom said you were in Boston.
The beer's very cold.
It's really cold today.
Though he is rich, he is not happy.
A bee sting can be very painful.
She gave birth to twin girls.
Tom opened the curtains.
Tom comes here once a month.
It was a very cold winter.
She wore a simple dress.
Frankly, I don't like that man.
This clock isn't working.
Slow down.
He forgot to give back my dictionary.
You can't tickle yourself.
Someday you should give it a try.
How do you usually decide what to eat?
I think I just heard somebody scream.
You have a big nose.
How much time does the average teenager watch TV every day?
I don't feel much like dancing.
It was all done.
I hope my dream will come true.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
Not everyone is like you.
Is that a problem?
Tom saw the newspaper on the floor and picked it up.
How do you know which one is yours?
The garrison was forced to surrender.
I want to see your house.
We're not so different, you and I.
Thanks in advance.
Tom has to speak French every day at work.
Who ordered pizza?
Tom isn't working.
I don't know yet.
Tom is asleep on the couch.
It was because he was sick that he decided to return home.
I met him on the previous day.
I want to do that with Tom.
It was enticing.
Can you still remember where we first met?
She speaks English really well.
She was unkind to him.
No one's gambling.
We can't keep on fooling ourselves.
The kids are already here.
Who's Tom? Is he your new boyfriend?
How's that again?
Tom will be here every day.
I remember those days.
Are you a good golfer?
He came back at nine o'clock.
I'm tired of him bawling me out.
I'm just a little dizzy.
Let's continue from where we left off.
There's a lot to do.
I don't carry cash anymore.
His loss of memory is a psychological problem rather than a physical one.
He went shopping.
I'm letting you go.
He looked up at the night sky.
I kept my word.
Does it hurt a lot?
I can see myself in the mirror.
If I were you, I would buy it.
She is on friendly terms with him.
Something is wrong with the engine of my car.
I have a three-year contract.
They are as strong as us.
I'm happy, too.
It's fifty kilometers to Paris.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Are you really that stupid?
Many children learn to use a computer even before entering school.
Let me get that for you.
You're the boss.
By the way, have you ever been to Hokkaido?
He went to New York on Monday.
I read the report you wrote.
He cut through Sherwood Forest.
I can't really understand.
I don't know the facts.
He did all the legwork.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
Who told you to bring me here?
His new film is disappointing.
I know what this is about.
Tom took a picture of the flowers.
I just followed your instructions.
They're not all criminals.
No one ever saw such a thing.
I bet you're talking about Tom.
How about running?
I just want what everyone wants.
How dare you talk to my son like that!
He is pleased with his work.
Tom clearly doesn't want to be there.
I'm really starting to hate this town.
Do not come here.
Would you wait a second?
Our mother bought us a puppy.
She will be back within a week.
He was the one who suggested it.
Where do you get off telling me that?
The treatment is going successfully.
It's embarrassing.
He's a gambler.
He felt a sharp pain.
Where are we going to lunch?
You're incorrigible.
I'm going crazy.
Tom lives in a small town not too far from Boston.
What bothers me is his attitude.
Quit gambling.
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
He never loses hope.
Let me see.
Are you going to cut down all these trees?
Does she like chocolate?
I'm practising judo.
Don't you agree?
We have five fingers on each hand.
His way of thinking is very childish.
What do you want me to do?
Hokkaido is located in the northern part of Japan.
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were, but that's not going to happen.
They agreed on everything.
I understand the situation.
He comes from England.
He never opens his mouth without complaining about something.
They want me to organize the party.
Tom left his wife and children.
You're crafty.
If you are not going to the concert, then neither am I.
I hope you're not going to disappoint me.
I'm just beginning.
I was threatened.
You have so much potential.
Sunday follows Saturday.
Get me some water.
We hardly ever talk to each other anymore.
I want to punch you in your face.
I really wish I didn't have to go to that meeting this afternoon.
He probably won't become famous.
I am better than you.
The soul is immortal.
Our team may win.
I admit my mistake.
I'm fascinated by cats.
Two teas and a coffee, please.
I'd rather stay home with you.
Tom looked.
Tom tightened the knot.
Will you lend me some money?
As soon as I can figure out how to send money, I'll send you some.
I want to make sure nothing's broken.
How do you propose we do that?
This sentence is not a translation. It's the original.
I'm pleased to see you.
Tom wasn't sure.
You were happy, weren't you?
I don't want to get you into trouble.
Where's my jacket?
Don't forget your phone.
Keep a box of baking soda in the fridge to keep it smelling clean.
You're all alone.
You're wrong again.
We have a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
They say she's sick.
I enjoy salsa dancing.
What is microeconomics?
I heard it thunder in the distance.
What do you like about him?
He looks tired.
Hello, Tom. Good morning.
You are absolutely right.
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
I haven't got a chance.
There was a large audience at yesterday's concert.
You can't do it, can you?
I'll take a shortcut across the garden.
I'm afraid I differ with you on this point.
I was careful.
Tom is a bit paranoid.
We import grain from the United States.
He may become a baseball player.
He quit.
Half of them are students.
I'll jump in.
How about going to the movies on Saturday?
I think Tom didn't understand what you were saying.
All our attempts failed.
Is it far?
It was an advantage having learned Chinese while I was in school.
Am I making any sense?
How do I explain this?
Have a beer with me.
Go put some clean clothes on.
I'm undressing.
We're going to invite Tom and Mary to our Halloween party.
I thought you were injured.
Tom looks sick.
I remember telling her that news.
I think she is good at dancing.
He became famous throughout the world.
I'll be out of town next week.
Do you know any doctors who speak Japanese?
I can prove it to you.
They all have drinks.
I think of you as a friend.
When does the game begin?
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
You should use deodorant.
It was awesome.
Tom knits.
I have seen him quite recently.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
His garden is a work of art.
Maybe she won't come.
Could you leave me one?
Don't underestimate my power.
This hat is mine.
Remember what happened last time.
I'm not the one who should go.
Tom doesn't know.
It wasn't made of wood.
Now is your chance.
Tom has something to tell you.
Do you want a car?
Agriculture is an important industry in California.
Don't touch the stove.
Could you do me a favor?
We'll be back after the break.
What do you like to do in your free time?
What are you going to do tonight?
I want to learn how.
He makes it a rule to take a walk every morning.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
You're good.
I love you all.
Are you volunteering to help?
The old houses were torn down to make room for a supermarket.
She left her ticket at home.
The two brothers have died.
The play begins at 2 p.m.
How're you doing?
Are you going to eat those fries?
There's a lot of chit-chat.
He sprained his ankle.
The Titanic hit an iceberg.
I am the chosen one.
What do you spend most of your time doing?
You should distinguish between right and wrong.
It works well.
They hung streamers from the ceiling in preparation for the party.
It's getting hard.
Excess of politeness is annoying.
I have three times as many books as he does.
She has a wonderful personality.
I come every day.
My eyes get tired very easily.
I run my own business.
We heard something moving in the next room.
I know the poem by heart.
I'd like to borrow your car tomorrow.
She treated him like a king.
She writes to me once a month.
I banged my leg on the coffee table.
I'll be working.
I've never been so proud.
It's April first.
Is Tom ready for this?
We're not involved.
I'm a little curious.
I just want some answers.
You owe me thirty bucks.
Will you put down that paper and listen to me?
What are you sitting on?
You won't be shot.
I don't think we were followed.
He decided not to go.
Tom just can't seem to get along with Mary.
Be respectful.
I want something more.
He objected to my going out yesterday.
Tom is a security guard at the airport.
We're in luck.
This book is better than that one.
Do it right.
Get in the boat.
I finally escaped.
I always counted you as a friend.
I stopped smoking.
I figured you'd be impressed.
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
You're finicky.
I love spring.
He arrived after I had left.
He got the first prize.
That's all you can do.
Is that your sister?
How will you change this?
I'm not an early riser.
She doesn't speak Japanese at home.
I had to do everything alone.
Many people use ATMs to withdraw money.
Are you up for it?
I wanted to change.
You should do something you enjoy doing.
Tom looked a bit surprised.
Eat more fruit.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
He saw it also.
She will not be able to come here tomorrow.
I'm surprised Tom remembers us.
Did someone die?
Tom found your cap.
His wife is French.
I had stage fright at first, but I got over it quickly.
I am a very good chess player.
My uncle lived to be ninety.
Don't forget to floss.
Are you willing to make a deal?
Why not talk to her about it directly?
Where's all this coming from?
Nobody encouraged her.
Tom didn't ask me for permission.
They were wealthy.
What can I do to help you?
I think you are the one who broke it.
We felt sympathy for her.
Girls say that all the time.
Tokyo is the capital of Japan.
Did you sleep all right?
They addressed me as doctor.
Keep the dog out.
You can't be too careful in situations like this.
Whatever you do, you must do your best.
I think it won't rain this afternoon.
Does he live here?
Am I hired?
Let's try it with this one.
Do you take work home with you?
I bought a new sewing machine.
She hired him as an interpreter because she had heard that he was the best.
Do you like English?
He asked his wife if she was coming with him.
No one can hear us.
Tom and Mary were both alcoholics.
He is always reading.
Something has gone terribly wrong.
Who are you talking to?
What exactly happened?
I know myself very well.
It's a piece of cake.
I'm not feeling too well.
I want you to come work for me.
It is rare for him to get angry.
I stayed home because it was raining.
I know Tom was first.
I'm not really worried.
We suspected him of lying.
He is considered one of the greatest scientists in our country.
I won't quit, no matter what you say.
I want you to get started right away.
You can no longer hurt me.
Tom kissed Mary.
She can speak French fluently.
Tom is sleeping in his bedroom.
I also heard a similar story.
Why are you in my house?
Could you actually eat this?
I thought that was your job.
She often goes to the movies with him.
Tom waited a while.
The store is already closed.
He is a man of wisdom.
I think that he is right.
Which is your luggage?
He is busy preparing for the trip.
Tom didn't give us any details.
Tom tried to conceal the truth.
Did Tom kill himself?
I'm getting married this year.
I hate this job.
You have brought shame upon our family.
Opponents say genetically engineered crops can cross-pollinate and damage other crops.
He's always chasing girls.
It is time you went to bed. Turn off the radio.
Do you know any good places to eat around here?
Won't you come to the party tomorrow?
They were murdered.
Tom certainly gave the impression that he wasn't planning on being there tomorrow.
Keep to the left, please.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
They say that a large dam will be built.
The plates are dirty.
Do you know where I'll end up if I take this road?
"Thank you for helping me." "Don't mention it."
How did you come by this painting?
It could be big trouble.
This part of the museum is temporarily off-limits to visitors.
No one believed him.
This is how I did it.
I would like to drink something.
Where is the station?
Don't touch anything without asking.
They aren't the kind of people you should want to be friends with.
They were playing tennis.
If I had known it, I would have told you.
Show us what you've got.
Please follow the school rules.
Everything seems to be in order.
I think we should stick to the original plan.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her the truth.
We finally have you where we want you.
Is it all right to eat out tonight?
We were startled by the explosion.
I'm impressed with your French.
What are you doing at school this afternoon?
I don't have anybody who'll listen to me.
Anybody home?
She ordered him to do it.
I feel like throwing up.
You can't prove a thing.
I pretended to be asleep.
I don't trust talkative people.
You're not telling me the truth.
I want to get a sightseeing visa.
How are you?
He works as a translator.
I'm practically an expert now.
He died within a few days of his hundredth birthday.
You're going to have to call Tom.
It's human nature.
Tom had dirt underneath his fingernails.
He's likely to be late.
My muscles were aching and I was tired.
I have a ton of work to do today.
I'd like to study French.
You can't keep this a secret.
We can't leave our tents on the beach where they are now. If we do, they'll be under water during high tide.
What if something goes wrong?
I don't really have a family.
It is an endangered species.
He went on singing.
Tom knew that Mary loved John.
I heard a woman scream.
You're not my friend.
Help yourself to the strawberry jam.
Do you think we should abandon ship?
Keep quiet.
How often do you shower?
You should fulfill your promises.
The prisoners were set free.
We went to Boston, where we stayed a week.
The water turned to ice.
I had some free time, so I wandered around town.
Tom asked Mary to do that, so you don't have to.
We're quite drunk.
Try to avoid bad company.
I just want people to like me.
Try another door.
I owe him nothing.
I want you to go home.
I smoked when I was young.
You aren't as short as me.
It's all right. I can wait.
You have to be careful.
I saw you snickering.
Drastic measures must be taken to prevent the further spread of the virus.
I have to finish what I started.
Do you have to go now?
Stand aside.
Does anyone else hear that?
It's not too much.
I have good hearing.
Could you send up some stomach medicine?
Don't do it again.
She cannot stop us.
You shouldn't let your girlfriend borrow your iPhone.
Tom understands French.
What does that sign say?
We need our demands to be met.
Tom tells me you're his assistant.
Did your mother make those?
I'm fine with it.
Could you please tell me how tall you are and how much you weigh?
I have lost my pen.
What season do you like the best?
I know exactly where I want to go.
What is your house like?
I don't know which of you is older.
My family is not all that large.
You are holding my hand in that picture.
There seem to be lots and lots of stars.
Will you be eating here or is this to go?
Really?
You have to be here at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
I wish I had more time to talk with her.
Ask her what her name is.
"Shut up," he whispered.
I want to stay in the house.
I could be next.
I'm so cold.
When did I ever hurt you?
You have to see it to believe it.
Are you sure you want to leave now?
I have to fight.
Get off my back!
I was arrested last week.
She advised him to go to the hospital.
That's a fake.
What did you do exactly?
I knew I'd be blamed.
I'm not very likely to be arrested for doing that.
Both of them started laughing.
I want you to have a copy of this.
I want to go to sleep soon because I need to get up early tomorrow.
He is always giving presents to his wife.
Don't you hang up on me.
How can you be so sure of that?
Why are you surprised?
Tom is going to do something about it.
We have no complaints.
That's the last straw!
We did that yesterday.
He can't walk any more.
You must be very special.
He appeared from nowhere.
I have to go to sleep.
They did it in front of the staff.
I would've told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
She doesn't have many friends in this town.
Tom scared the children.
I destroyed all the evidence.
It didn't happen that way.
I never made such a promise.
Would you do something for me?
This picture was taken three years ago.
I'm staying over at my friend's place.
I really need to talk to you privately.
I wasn't drunk.
Do I have to change my diet?
I think this will do nicely.
How long do I have to wait for delivery?
I didn't think that you could do that.
That book is familiar to all young children.
He stood there with his eyes closed.
It was a great trip.
We could wait.
There were some boats on the lake.
Only a handful of people know the fact.
This door would not open.
My mother goes to the market every day to buy things.
He asked me who that man was.
I called my neighbors over for dinner.
Tom's room is empty.
Stay here all night if you want.
You never arrive on time.
I'm able to run.
I don't want this shirt.
I usually go to bed at ten.
I can put up with a house being untidy, but I don't like it to be dirty.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
I think we're finished here.
I'm not tired yet.
Doing that sort of thing makes you look stupid.
The reason is very simple.
She has known better days.
Maybe Tom was the one who stole Mary's necklace.
I wasn't prepared for this.
I like neither of the pictures.
I can't remember anything about that night.
Why is Tom so afraid of Mary?
I heard voices on the other side of the door.
She is able to skate.
I'll do anything I can for Tom.
I must visit my friend in the hospital.
That's certainly one possibility.
I was moved to tears by the story.
We have lots to do.
Are you making fun of me?
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you.
It was a fluke.
I want you all to be on your best behavior.
I did it for him.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
I think it's a terrible law.
He is respected by them.
Is your mother here?
The government is promoting the use of domestically made products.
Do you really think you can do that?
Which is the most difficult language in the world?
You must do it quickly.
I didn't realize you were awake.
They never did what they said they would do.
The old man was accompanied by his grandchild.
Admission is free for preschool children.
I like spring the best.
I want to pretend it never happened.
It's my duty to help you.
I feel alive.
Why are you all sad?
It is wrong to steal money.
My uncle comes back from America next Monday.
I could help.
I can barely see it.
Are you coming or not?
I trusted you.
Is that all you want to know?
Why are you doing this to me?
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
I was moved by his tears.
Tom certainly gets a nice sound out of that old bassoon.
I can't go in there.
Oranges have a lot of vitamin C.
He went to the dentist.
You were drunk, weren't you?
Tom can't speak French without making a lot of mistakes.
What happened to my furniture?
We're not your enemy.
I think you'd better leave.
She will be here this evening.
I've got a friend at the IRS.
My sister is also my best friend.
Friendship is a matter of trust.
Tom made himself something to eat.
What's the spelling of your family name?
I want much more.
She intended to go shopping.
I'll show you around the town.
Are you expecting someone?
Quit acting like a baby.
He gave it to me.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
I'm sympathetic.
You can't park your car here.
We couldn't convince him.
Sorry I couldn't come over yesterday. Something came up.
The bicycle is mine.
I just don't feel that way about you.
The clock has just struck three.
I like astrology.
I felt as if I had no choice.
We must never do this again.
What is wrong with her?
I've drifted apart from my friends.
The line is busy now. Please hold the line.
I wasn't conscious of anyone watching me.
I like both.
I'm happy for you both.
It was all just a big misunderstanding.
She loves him now more than she did before.
All major credit cards are accepted.
It's a pity that you can't come.
I had a really great time tonight.
You still haven't told me who he is.
My father failed in business.
What do you think he did?
I don't want to hear any more excuses.
Do your parents speak French?
I want to settle down.
It appears to me that you put on my hat by mistake.
Tom and Mary don't want to talk to John.
No one's shooting at us now.
You can't tell anyone about this.
Choose between these two.
Tom's future remains uncertain.
We all had the same idea.
You've got everything you need.
When did you start dating?
Someone stole my bicycle.
Loosen up.
You've got to wake up.
This story has a happy ending.
Man has the gift of speech.
I had to make a speech at short notice.
I can't wait.
Could you put those bags in the car for me?
Do you think you can manage to keep things going until I get back?
Tom is going to beat you.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
Don't tell anybody.
I couldn't stop laughing.
It's not irrelevant.
I don't believe Tom would do that.
This seems risky.
How did you spend your free time?
Your telephone's ringing, Tom.
I agree with what you say to some extent.
Add a bit of sugar, please.
The Olympic Games are held every four years.
I don't really feel sick.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
Do you think it's a good idea to feed your dog table scraps?
I'll never forget the sight.
Tom isn't sure this is a good plan.
I started crying.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Bad weather kept us from going out.
They drank two bottles of wine.
Someone is inside.
What did those two men want from you?
Try another door.
Tom couldn't borrow as much money as he needed.
Tom checked the date.
She has an eye for the beautiful.
What'll you be doing this summer?
Ask me anything you like.
Part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience.
She called to tell me that her husband would be out of town for the weekend.
Tom tried to keep calm.
Over three thousand people attended the concert.
Who painted this painting?
I don't have a spare shirt.
Tom always speaks French.
Please tell me the story once more.
Why would anybody come here?
Keep the door closed.
You're very understanding.
I have a brain tumor.
I didn't know you could speak French.
They have no choice.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
So, why are you here?
No matter how hard you may try, you won't succeed so easily.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
He is afraid of his own shadow.
I'm not good at pretending.
I've never read a novel in French.
Be kind to those around you.
What'd the doctor say?
I've been impressed with Tom's work.
I wrote this song just for you.
You can't pick who you fall for.
Tom knows that won't work.
It's no use trying to intimidate me.
What time does the first train leave?
I read the book up to page 80 yesterday.
I have lost face completely.
He owns a lot of land.
Tom is reading in his bedroom.
Tom has decided to leave the company.
How many songs have you written?
I don't know what to say to Tom.
I had two cups of coffee.
I couldn't help laughing when I heard that story.
I want to find someplace quiet to study.
Tom and Mary had a whirlwind romance.
The cause of the fire is unknown.
It's dangerous here.
I hate that you have to leave.
Don't let him do it alone.
Am I a bad person?
Do you want to do this?
Where's the oar?
What does Tom want for his birthday?
I get arrested from time to time.
The pain in my stomach has gone.
Did you send them?
My uncle gave him a present.
I am alarmed by your irresponsible attitude.
I wish I could change that.
